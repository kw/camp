    Specifically, it keeps track of how many spells of each class (in its sphere) are
    known compared to the base number of spells known for those classes, plus any
    bonuses from skills that increase the number of spells you can have in your spellbook.

    Why is this not tracked per-class? Each class grants a number of spells known that must
    come from that particular class. But the more generic skills instead let you take spells
    from any class in your sphere (simplifying a bit). So we need to track the number of
    spells taken from each class in the sphere so that we can attribute any overages to the generic
    slots
