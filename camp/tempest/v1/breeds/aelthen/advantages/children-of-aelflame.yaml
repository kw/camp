description: |
  Deep connections within the breed manifest themselves in those who are ritually bonded together, though this connection seems only to extend as far as those who at least tangentially claim this Aelthen birthright. The Character gains the Boon Bonds Perk as a Breed Advantage from the Character Options Chapter. However, the three characters chosen must be of the Aelthen Breed as well.
