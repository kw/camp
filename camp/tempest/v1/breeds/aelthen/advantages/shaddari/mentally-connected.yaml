  The Shaddari are well known to have a strange knack for intuiting the location of useful resources. Some say they naturally “feel” the ley lines of the land, others just claim to be inordinately “lucky”. The character counts as having purchased the Dowser Supernatural Perk as a Breed Advantage from the Character Options Chapter.
