  Those Aelthen who trace their ancestry back beyond the great planar migration often have natural magic. If they take Roles with spell-casting requirements (or that require spell-casting classes), the Character Point cost for those Roles is 1 lower, to a minimum of 0. In addition, if the character gains Novice spell-slots from any basic classes, the Shaddari gains one bonus Novice spell-slot. The character may only gain one additional slot this way.

  ### CMA Note

  Once you've taken a casting class, come back here and confirm
  the sphere of your bonus slot.

# TODO(#131): Figure out how to grant a CP discount on any role that
# requires spellcasting.
