  _“Though the Aelthen come from beyond the known planes, none that we know of predate the migration to Tempest. Some historical records claim they came willingly, others that they were forced here by a catastrophe that sealed away their homelands forevermore. Regardless, they remain one of the few links to the realms beyond, and the aspected nature of their forms belie a lingering connection to that forbidden place._

  _The ritualistic nature of the transformation into the Aspects is a closely guarded secret, known only to the elders of the Aelthen, however, what is common knowledge is that they derive their power from something called the Aelflame: a deific source of power brought with them from their long lost home._

  _One hopes that whatever would drive an entire civilization, let alone one empowered by such a source of power, across the span of the realms should never arrive here.”_

  ## Description

  Aelthen are a breed of long-lived, arcane outsiders who typically present as a pointy eared, shimmery skinned humanoid with sharp fangs. These beings draw their inner powers from an ancient boon granted by a cosmic, deific wyrm who’s name is lost to time. This blessing is commonly referred to as the Aelflame. Within the spirit of all Aelthen lies a spark that can be awakened by a ritual performed by the most ancient of Aelthen - The Aeldest.

  The ritual itself is a closely guarded secret and many Aelthen spend their entire lives without their spark having been enkindled. In some cases, the Aeldest may guide a young Aelthen to ignite their flame early in their life, though the motives of this choice are often not revealed to anyone. The ignition of one's Aelflame is as much a rite of passage as it is a social boon, as those who undergo the rite often “bloom”: a rather significant physical transformation. This ritual always includes three Aelthen who each become one of the three subspecies, one of each. Rite-Sibilings commonly feel a strong bond with one another, and follow each other's exploits from afar, if they don’t outright keep in close contact.
