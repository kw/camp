  ## The Aspect of Body

  Aelthen who find themselves attuned to the Body are invigorated with energy directly from the Aelflame. Their eyes naturally tend to shade towards warmer colors, such as gold, red, and orange and their ears shorten to just barely pointed human-like ears. Their hair commonly has streaks of metallic gold and thin veins of gold present themselves over the large portions of the Ætori’s body as a result of the magical energy surging through to their muscles.
  The Ætori are physical marvels: their reflexes are lightning fast, and are often unnaturally graceful. They are capable of quickly healing themselves, leaving golden scars scattered over their bodies, as well as an ability to unleash catastrophic amounts of power in short bursts burning their own flesh from within...
