  ## The Aspect of Soul

  Aelthen who are attuned to the Soul are emotional savants and have an impassioned sentimentality. Their forms tend towards jewel-like tones that are deeply saturated, like sapphires, emeralds, and amethyst. Their skin often takes on a similar blush with unearthly hues dominating the cheeks, hair that falls in blue, green, and purple cascades, eyes like cool gemstones, and lips like freshly cut aloe. Many have prominent ears that exceed a handâ€™s breadth, often coming out near perpendicular from their heads.

  Bellorae are capable of embracing and manipulating emotion to their benefit. They can force an uncomfortable sense of fear in their foes, or lend an object or location a sense of calmness and tranquility. This can often present itself in a literal healing, where mending the frantic emotions of an ally also closes physical wounds.
