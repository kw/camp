  You werenâ€™t chosen by the Bellorae Aelflame, and it has no intention of letting you forget it. It often refuses your commands of it, so much so as to twist your intentions. Whenever using a Heal effect from either a Power or Spell, you must expend a Spike or suffer X Final by Spite, where X is the amount healed. In addition, you have one fewer maximum Spikes.
