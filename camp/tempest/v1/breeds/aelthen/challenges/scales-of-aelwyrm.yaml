description: |
  Small patches of purple scales adorn the bodies of some Aelthen, often on the neck, cheeks, forehead, or forearms. While the specific hue varies from Aelth to Aelth, they are always some shade of purple. The individual scales must be distinct from one another, and must represent a scale pattern. After the ignition of the Aelthen’s Aelflame, the color of their scales may change, but not always: Ætori scales may be gold, red, or orange. Bellorae may be green or blue. Shaddari scales may be silver or gray. Note that these additional color options are restricted by the Aelthen’s chosen Sub-Breed.
