  As the Shaddari Aelflame within you began to take hold, something stirred as it mixed with your spirit, and became dark. Any Rituals you take part in, or are a target of, increase dark territory by two. In addition, you gain only half the normal amount of healing from all sources that do not have the “by Darkness“ accent.
