  Occasionally, the Aelthen find themselves better able to focus when they have a representation of the Aelflame available to them - whether this is simply a tool to maintain mental focus, or an actual magical conduit is unclear. The Aelthen must carry, or have on them visibly, a lit vessel, lantern, glowing crystal or other illuminated object in order to access any breed advantages; this must be a repped object with a visible light source with at least two dimensions greater than four inches.
