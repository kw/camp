  ## The Aspect of Mind

  Aelthen of the Mind are calculating masterminds, with an immaculate understanding of the world. Their eyes are often pale and milky, or jet black, and their skin often has a silvery overtone that is marked by veins of pure silver coming from their eyes and hairline. Their ears remain the same length as the unattuned Aelthen, but often become twisted and gnarled like that of a bat.

  The Shaddari have an incredible natural mental acuity, and while this doesnâ€™t necessarily make them smarter than anyone else, they do possess a powerful memory for the intricacies of magic. The Shaddari are often born with an innate magical sense, and find it even easier to add to their collection of knowledge over time, even when they devote themselves to other pursuits.
