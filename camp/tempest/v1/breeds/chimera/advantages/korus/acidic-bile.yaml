  _“T’skara licked his fangs as the group of unruly tavern-goers approached him with weapons in hand. It’s truly unfortunate that they weren’t taught some of his reptilian cousin’s tricks. He considered himself a fine educator. Three quick flits of his tongue against the back of his grooved fangs, and they were each covering their eyes, screaming in agony. T’skara took his drink, and waved a thank you to the bar-tender.”_
