Provided that this power is not resisted, misses, or negated in any way, the mythid becomes Strengthened while carrying the target of Abduct, and may pick up the body of their target immediately by saying “Strengthened, I pick you up.” The mythid may not attempt to harm the target of Abduct until they can reasonably assume they are unwatched by any others.
