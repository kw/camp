  A Mythid riled is a dangerous opponent at the best of times. When they focus their ire, they can become truly implacable foes. Once per Long Rest, the Character may gain plus one to their Spike Damage until their next Short Rest. In addition, they  gain _Resistance_ to a number of Root effects equal to the Mythidâ€™s maximum Life Points, until their next Long Rest.
