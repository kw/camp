description: |
  The Chimera transforms from one form to another, which may be less animal-looking or even entirely non-animal-looking. The change must be done out of combat during a Short Rest, and is usually done in private. While in her transformed state, the Chimera character cannot use any Breed Advantages (or other benefits purchased with Breed Points) from Chimera except Transformation itself, but may also choose not to have any of the physical Chimera Breed Challenges represented.
