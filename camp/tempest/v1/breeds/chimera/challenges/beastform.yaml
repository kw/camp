  Crafted from the best nature has to offer, the Beastform is an amalgamation of the traits most suited to the Chimeraâ€™s environment. The Chimera may take any combination of the following traits: Stub Tail, Snout, Beastly Ears, Fangs, Horns, Hide, Paws, Tail, or Chitin for up to six points of Chimera Challenges. A player may choose to represent additional Beastform traits, but will not gain Breed points for doing so.
