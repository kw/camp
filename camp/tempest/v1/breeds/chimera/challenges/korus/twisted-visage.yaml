description: |
  The Korusâ€™ form is aberrant and twisted, calling out to the shapes and form of those things that go bump in the night. The Korus may take any combination of the following traits: Fins, Dagger mouth, Antennae, Quills, Unguligrade Legs and Hooves for up to six points of Chimera Challenges. A player may choose to represent additional Twisted Visage traits, but will not gain Breed points for doing so.
