name: A Thing from Deepest Places
award: 1
grants: indoor-discomfort
description: |
  Mythid don’t often find themselves in the company of others- It’s not about the others as much as it is about the Mythid. They are creatures of the Deepest Places, where naught but darkness can penetrate the grasping canopy. They are at home here, not within the safe walls of a Tavern. This Character has the Indoor Discomfort Flaw from the Character Options Chapter as a Breed Challenge.
