description: |
  Taking the chimera’s form in a singular direction, the Scavat’s features largely hail from a single creature, giving a continuity to the shapes and patterns they exhibit. The Scavat may take any combination of the following traits: Wings, Shell, Tusks, Small Antlers, Antlers, and Hooves for up to six points of Chimera Challenges. A player may choose to represent additional Hewn Form traits, but will not gain Breed points for doing so.
