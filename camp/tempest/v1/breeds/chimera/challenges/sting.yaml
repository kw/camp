description: |
  The Chimera's tail terminates in either large bulbous stinger, or long vicious spines. The challenge requires a tail of at least two feet in length, terminating in a sharp-looking appendage reminiscent of a spine or stinger. The representation of the tail must be safe, such that it does not injure the wearer or others that might land on it.
