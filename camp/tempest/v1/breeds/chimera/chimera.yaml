name: Chimera
description: |
  _“Chimera are a breed of beast-like creatures whose spawn often take on new or variant traits based on a logic still unknown to us._

  _The changes from chimera mother to chimera daughter may be extreme (and often are), with one manifesting traits that cause them to resemble some sort of avian hybrid, and the other being a scale-covered reptilian. Chimera are sometimes born to non-chimera parents, the touch slumbering in their blood until it manifests with enough strength to re-write their parents' own._

  _Thus, chimera have been observed to take on many different animalistic traits from the local fauna, sometimes in beautiful arrangements, and sometimes reminiscent of aberrant nightmares.”_

  Description

  The true origin of Chimerism has been lost to the ages, however, its effects are widely understood: Chimera sire Chimera. When a Chimera bears a child; be it with Human, Aelth, or Drimmen, their child will be Chimera. The traits they manifest by being one, however, are essentially unknowable until they manifest a few years after birth.
  Chimerism takes on animal-like traits that are set over the shape of another breed; a Human with dog ears, an Aelth with the claws and tail of an alligator, or a Drimmen with the head of a cat.

  There exist four known strands of Chimerism, which are based on the host’s reaction to the Touch of the Chimera; the academic name for their condition. The first is simply known as the Chimera and are the most common. They are your animal folk, with little effect from the Touch.

  As the Touch becomes more expressive, the mutations and traits become altogether more unconstrained. The Scavat seems to draw strongly on a single animal, expressing traits across the entire body. For the Korus, many are considered abominations - monsters in their own right. Finally, Mythids barely resemble their non-chimeric parents at all, expressing themselves almost entirely as mythological creatures.
