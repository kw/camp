  ## The Assembled

  In the Korus, the Touch manifests non-uniformly: too many limbs, claws, or a spectrum of aberrant physicalities from a myriad of forms. To other breeds, the Korus are obviously wrong, and yet, they remain functional, and often terrifyingly so.

  For the Korus, the Touch is the source of being, and revered as such. Korus are often grateful, perceiving the Touch has anointed them as “special” or above all others, and they are not quiet about this supposedly lofty position. In addition, some clans of Korus ascribe a certain kind of reverence for particular physical traits or sets of traits, elevating those above the rest.
