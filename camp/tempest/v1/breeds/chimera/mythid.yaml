  ## The Molded

  The Touch is complete, and reveled in - what little otherwise mortal breed remains pales in comparison to the myriad of traits taken on by the Mythid. The Mythid is a wholesale transformation from the typical breeds, merging many different animal traits to create a completely different, and often unique, form.

  The Mythids themselves are often as uniquely minded about their transformations as the forms they reside in. Many turn to seclusion to avoid persecution or suspicion, but a rare few seek to join the communities they once resided in, with wildly varying success. Those few who do manage to return, find themselves often the town’s “mascot” of sorts, with some communities being doggedly protective of “their” mythid.
