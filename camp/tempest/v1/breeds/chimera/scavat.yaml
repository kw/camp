  ## The Cast

  In the Scavat, the Touch manifests uniformly and strongly: one particular form dominates the rest, giving them a sort of “recognition” among the other breeds as more palatable. However, this perception is an illusion, as a Scavat with primarily feline or canine features might suddenly bare their fangs to show them dripping with poison, or a lupine-dominant form’s fur coat might hide turtle-like shell plating underneath.

  The Touch for the Scavat can take on many implications, from a family curse, to divine providence, or anywhere in between, though commonly many simply accept themselves for who they are, and seek out both like-formed and like-minded to create small communities they can pursue their lives with a minimum of hassle.
