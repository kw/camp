  The rahl’s rage is often barely checked, and once released, difficult to contain. Woe to the individual that sees the final breath of a Rahl, for they may join them in death. Once per Event, when the character is Deathblowed or killed with a melee attack, she can do damage to the one who attacked her. After a loud yell of pain they may call “[Name or Description], who killed me: 10 by Flame.”
