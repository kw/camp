  The common conception of the Vahg as packrats may have some air of truth to it, but few can complain when the packrat provides exactly what is needed, right when it is needed. Provided the Vagh has the challenge **Everything But the Sink**, they may provide a physical rep for a mundane item to fill the position of a similar mundane item that the player may need in a scene. For instance a gardening trowel to be used like a grapple hook. This ability may be used once per Short Rest, and validity of the substitution is up to the attending marshal. This cannot be used in place of tagged items, such as those used for Gathering.
