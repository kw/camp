  Multiple thick bands of geometric lines run across the Drimmenâ€™s arms, body, or legs. They are typically straight, but may be jagged or curved. A Drimmen character taking this challenge must represent at least 4 of these lines on skin that would be exposed and visible when the character is in warm weather. Multiple lines may be joined end to end, But generally must be an inch thick and 4 - 5 inches long. These lines may shift over time.
