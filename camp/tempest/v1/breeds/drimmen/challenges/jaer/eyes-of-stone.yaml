description: |
  In rare situations Jaer will have their eyes glazed over to a milky gray. The player must wear gray or white eye contacts. Scleral contacts are not allowed for safety reasons. In addition, the character must represent blue veins extending from the eyes across their face, regardless of chosen color. This challenge is mutually exclusive with The Fracture.
