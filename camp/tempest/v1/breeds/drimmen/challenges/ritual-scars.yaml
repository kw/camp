  The scar tissue on Drimmen bodies are often heavily pigmented from their ancestor runes, giving them a bold coloration. Skin that would be exposed and visible when the character is in warm weather should be striped with these scars. These scars may not be the same coloration as runes manifested through either the Ancestorâ€™s Mask or Conduit's challenges. These scars may shift over time.
