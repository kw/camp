description: |
  Sometimes accused of being overtly greedy, some Vahg are collectors of esoterica and items that most would see as worthless. Leaving items of perceived value behind is occasionally enough to send them spiraling into delirious fits. If forced to leave behind items of significant value, the Vahg loses one Maximum Spike until their next Long Rest.
