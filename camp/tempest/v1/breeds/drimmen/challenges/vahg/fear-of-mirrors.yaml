  When presented with their own image in a well polished mirror, the Vahg perceives a horrifying visage replacing their own. This may be an identifiable horror they are familiar with, or a new and novel one every time. After being made to view their own reflection in non-combat situations, the Vahg takes a Long Drain by Will.
