description: |
  The Vahg rarely have a specific item that is tied to them by some unnatural event. The item could be anything, really, though it tends to be a child’s toy or trinket. This item must be a conspicuous item that they carry on their person, and if stolen, the Vahg takes an Inherent Taint by Madness. If the item is returned, the “Inherent” portion of the effect is removed. If the item is not returned, the Vahg must choose a new Precious Momento after resurrection. This item must be larger than a 4” by 4” by 4” cube.
