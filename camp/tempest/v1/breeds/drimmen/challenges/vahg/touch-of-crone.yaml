  Every Vagh knows the story of the loss of Cedric inside the old crone’s house: _“Cedric and Magda never quite saw eye to eye with one another, but when pressed about the Crone’s house in the woods, Magda was excited to explore the old place with him. Cedric was never found again, but it is said that the old Crone cursed his soul to wander the ancient buildings of their long lost family, to continue trapping unwary prey for the Cannibal Crone.”_ The Vahg may take the Indoor Discomfort character option as a Breed Disadvantage.
