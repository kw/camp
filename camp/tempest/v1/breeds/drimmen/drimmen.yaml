name: Drimmen
description: |
  _“Drimmen, the bridge between the common folk and giants, are rarely seen amongst normal folk due to a common preference of living in seclusion, but thanks to explorers, traders, and the ever growing expansion of nations, communities of Drimmen have started to frequent cities._

  _These days, Drimmen are somewhat more welcoming to outsiders, but remain wary of them until they have proven themselves. Once proven, however, their temperament changes dramatically, often throwing feasts to share their bounties as though welcoming a prodigal family member home._

  _Drimmen can be distinguished by the geometric shaped birthmarks on their bodies. These are often on their faces, head, arms, or legs. These marks can vary in a wide array of colors, though it’s not always clear what they signify. They commonly wear elaborate furs when they are amongst their communities, but you can find them also wearing common clothes when they visit our cities, preferring not to call more attention to themselves than necessary.”_

  ## Description

  The heartiest of the common folk, the Drimmen are a breed descended from the ancient Drim. The Drim were known commonly as the Old Giants; separate, yet similar to the current day Giants. Most Drimmen can, even if indirectly, trace their bloodline back to three major Drim bloodlines: Drim-Jaer, Drim-Rahl, and Drim-Vahg. Drimmen are commonly well-known for the thick bands of runes that shift over their bodies, denoting their ancestral line. While they are hardy creatures, they tend to scar easily, and those scars tend to be very visible, a trait they often boast with pride, carrying the tales of battles upon their skin as if a record of prowess.
