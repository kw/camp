  The Jaer are those born of the Drim-Jaer; The Giants of vast glacial passes and frozen mountains. They tend to be contemplative: a trait shared with the Jaer themselves, pondering options for a considerable time before a decision is made. They are not unintelligent, quite to the contrary, many Jaer make for excellent scholars. It is perhaps better to say that when a Jaer speaks or acts, itâ€™s often done after careful consideration and judgment. The Jaer do not take bold action lightly, but when they do act, they commit to those actions and see them to the end. The Jaer are often easily identifiable by rocky protrusions, ridges, or cliffs that adorn their bodies, like scales or horns. Some share the same trait with their eyes, having an eerie, blank stone stare.
