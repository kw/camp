  Any battleshaper worth their salt has heard the expression “Who brought the Rahl?”, which equates roughly to “What the hell happened?”. The Drimmen Rahl, the source of this expression, earned such a title for their fiery, explosive passion, and bursts of energy and strength. While the Jaer are the embodiment of “consider the possibilities,”the Rahl are the embodiment of “live fast, die young.” The Rahl are born with an instinctual passion for a great many things, though those passions range from something as simple as their craftwork, to something as complex as “The Iron taste of blood on your lips after battle.”

  Rahl are often quite easy to spot in a crowd, not by seeing, but by hearing. They are the loudest and most boisterous, and tend to have strong voices that carry easily. Otherwise, they can often be told apart from their brothers and sisters by a trait known as the Arm of Brogdar. The Arm of Brogdar is, for lack of a better word, a stone arm. This stone arm is often disproportionate, resembling a strange, stone cast, or as if the limb had simply been transplanted onto them. Rahl tends to have difficulties wielding weapons or shields with this strange arm.
