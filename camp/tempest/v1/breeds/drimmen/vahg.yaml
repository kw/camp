  One might think these creature's ancestors were shaped from the muck and detritus of the swamp itself, however the Vahg have simply adapted to the environs around them, frequently passing unnoticed in swamps and bogs despite the often giant hoards piled upon their backs and bags. Known for surprising strength and stamina, the defining trait of the Vogh is perseverance.

  Most Vahg excel in outdoor environments, where a mentality of preparedness dominates their thoughts. It’s speculated that this has caused most Vahg to have an instinctual apprehension of leaving anything of theirs behind: for them, it’s simply easier to pack everything that’s theirs onto their strong backs and hit the road with it.
