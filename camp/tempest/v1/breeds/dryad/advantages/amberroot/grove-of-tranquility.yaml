description: |
  Peace, Calm, and Tranquility are the hallmarks of any true grove, and within that place, the Amberoot can recenter themselves, and gain insight not only to themselves, but the world around them. Once per event, so long as you are in the wilderness, you may refresh one of your “once per Short Rest” Powers that you have already used. Choose a Power you have already used, Focus for a Quick 100, and call out “Refresh [Power Name] by Will” to gain an additional use of that Power. This Breed Power may only be used where you are touching a tree or there are multiple trees between you and any visible buildings.
