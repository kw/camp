  Nature teaches that life surges and ebbs with the flow of wind, weather, and tide, and that every bounty must be appreciated to the fullest. Any healing received beyond the Amberoots’ Life Point maximum is converted to Barrier. This Barrier can’t be greater than the Maximum amount of Barrier the Character is allowed to have.
