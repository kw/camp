description: |
  The physiology of the Drift is somewhat of an enigma, as the parasitic nature of the breed names that each is, in some fashion, unique. This can make it difficult to kill, as one may simply not have it’s heart where another’s would be. This Character gains the Unkillable Perk from the Character Options Chapter as a Breed Advantage.
