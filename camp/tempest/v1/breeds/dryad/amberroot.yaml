  The “eldest” of the Dryads, in some ways, or at least the most familiar to the other breeds, Amberroots are more often confused for other breeds than their rocky or fungal cousins, though the bar isn’t high. Often Amberroots appear similar to other breeds - right up until close inspection: the most common trait of an Amberroot is their namesake: large plate of translucent amber winding across the exposed skin of the dryad.

  Often bright, cheerful, and protective of the natural world, Amberroots are likely the source of the never-ending speculation that Dryads are somehow related to the Fae. However, despite rebuttals from both sides, the rumors and mythology continue to persist.
