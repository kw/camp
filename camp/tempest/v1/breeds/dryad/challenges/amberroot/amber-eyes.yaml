  Much like their other dryad cousins, the “blood” that runs in the veins of the amberroot is not always similar to other breeds. The amber hue can be reflected in the tint of their eyes, giving an unearthly gaze. The Character must wear golden/amber eye contacts. Scleral contacts are not allowed for safety reasons.
