  Their namesake, the amber-like stones and plates that cover these dryads seem to both be part of the dryads, and yet somehow distinct. This Character must wear small amber gems on some exposed parts of the skin, this will reward 2 Breed Points for the challenge. This Challenge can reward 4 Breed Points if a whole limb is made to look like a smooth amber gem.
