description: |
  While the host of a Drift is maintained, in some fashion, by the Drift itself and its natural processes, eventually the host takes on a rather sickly and sometimes rotten state over the years. The Character must represent a paled bruised skin tone across half the character’s exposed skin, and generally represent the host’s decayed form.
