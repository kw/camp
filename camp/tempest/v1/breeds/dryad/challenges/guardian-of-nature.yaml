name: Guardian of Nature
award: 4
description: |
  Few dryads forsake nature, or the origins they come from, but some feel a keen calling to defend the natural world and their brethren and take up the mantle of Guardian of Nature.

  The character is bound to the following code:

  * You will defend and preserve natural life and other Dryad lives over your own.
  * You will not let the active destruction of nature occur.
  * You will treat natural creatures with respect and politeness.

  The character is required to obey the strictures as best as they can, and should the player realize that the character has broken the code she will lose access to her highest level Powers and will take a 1 point penalty to her maximum Life Point total. These will last until the character feels she has atoned for her failures in-game.
