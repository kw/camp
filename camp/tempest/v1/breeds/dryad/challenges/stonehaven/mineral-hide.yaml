  As stonehaven are constructed of natural elements, and this process seems less concerned with the “perfection” of the form, and more a generalized similarity, the stonehaven frequently has patches of the source stones embedded across their forms. This character must represent combat safe, jagged protrusions of minerals/crystals over at least three distinct exposed areas on their body.
