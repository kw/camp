  Stonehaven seem often to have less care and detail about how their forms mimic those of other breeds - in some more obvious examples, the number of fingers doesnâ€™t always quite match up. The Stonehaven is required to represent the hands being reduced to two fingers and a thumb, binding the pointer and middle finger together, and the index and pinky together. This representation should look rocky or crystalline in nature.
