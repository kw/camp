  _“Dryads? Oh, yeah, plenty of them around. They just blend in whenever they can. They can be a little shy at first, but they’ll come out soon enough._

  _Don’t worry, they can be downright amicable, provided you stick to the paths, collect only deadwood for your fire, and leave the forest pretty much how you found it. If you follow the rules, and are respectful, they might even join us for dinner._
  Just don’t rile them up too much, or you’ll spend all night drinking with them and end up lost in the Deepwood, moon over your head, and not a one of them in sight.
  Go ahead, ask me how I know…”

  ## Description

  Formed from the essence of the earth itself, Dryads encompass a wide variety of creatures that seem to attempt to defy classification. However, the most common and noteworthy are those that have approached the societies of other breeds in an attempt to live among them.

  Unknowably old, every other breed agrees that the dryads were among the first, if not the first breed to walk this plane, predating every nation's historical records into the far flung reaches of time immemorial. Interestingly, the perspective of the dryads is almost diametrically opposite - they seem to have little use for recorded history, seeming to take each day as it comes, and accepting the day before them in an almost tranquil way.

  However, one must not mistake the calm cool head frequently displayed by Dryads as some sort of naivete, or unwillingness to act: a Dryad stirred to action is a formidable sight, and attempting to halt one that has been wronged is liable to garner the same results as placing oneself, hand outstretched, in front of an avalanche.
