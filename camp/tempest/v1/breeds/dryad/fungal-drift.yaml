  The Fungal-Drift are an enigma, even unto the other dryads themselves. Born of the death of others, many might see their shambling bulk as assume the form is one of any number of undead, or perhaps a wretched abomination. However, the Fungal-Drift are simply part of the circle of life, rising from the graves and ashes of what was once alive, if in sometimes grotesque fashion: for the Fungal-Drift arise only from the bodies of slain members of other breeds, animating them with supple vines and utilizing the broken forms of their hosts to support themselves.

  Given their nature, the Fungal-Drift often tend to a rather lackadaisical attitude towards death and violence, sometimes preferring to ignore a fight right up until the last moment, and sometimes reveling in the “transition” of others, and being first to the front lines. Some suspect the shift in attitude has something to do with whether the given Drift is budding at the time, but none can say for sure.

  What is clear, is that the Drift are commonly given to a darker sense of humor than most, often dryly delivered, casually in conversation, and a rather dispassionate disposition overall.
