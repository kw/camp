  Seemingly an amalgam of the mortal races and the jagged peaks of a mountain, the stonehaven are the most likely to stand out among the communities they join, with crests of stone, and spires of crystal jutting out from mortal-seeming flesh. Rarely symmetrical, those protrusions seem to meander through the creature’s form as if the whole of its body was hewn from a sign block of stone, and the goal of matching the other breeds left unfinished.

  The stonehaven are among the most recent to join the world’s cosmopolitan societies, though “recent” in this context is still several centuries past. However, where they have arrived in significant numbers, the populace has taken note, as they remain stalwart and stoic, unflagging in labor and deed. Many professions have taken advantage of the Stonehaven’s nature, hiring them on as hard laborers, construction workers, and guards, as they rarely seem to complain about the work set before them.

  On the social side, stonehaven tend to collect and aggregate “favors” of a sort - their willingness to take on work others won’t has garnered them many an IOU from the poor to the elite alike, and when the stonehaven collect, it is often en masse, bringing all the accumulated effort to bear in one exceptional stroke. Major projects, languishing for years, suddenly seem to be built overnight, only to go silent again indefinitely.
