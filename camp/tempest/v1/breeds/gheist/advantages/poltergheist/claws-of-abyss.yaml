description: |
  Cold, transparent, and lifeless, but no less capable of drawing the life out of another, the hands of a poltergheist are potent weapons. A poltergheist that has taken the Black Nails Breed Challenge may use natural weapons. These must be boffer-safe representations of claws and must be approved by plot. These weapons cannot be dropped or removed, although they can be tucked away when not in combat in order to do other things with the hands. Sharp claws will count as Short Swords and the character will be automatically proficient. These weapons must be built to be under 36” long. In addition, the poltergheist may add the “by Darkness”, accent to any melee attack with these claws.
