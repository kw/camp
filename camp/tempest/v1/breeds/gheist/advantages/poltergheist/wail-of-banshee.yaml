  While poltergheist are barely tolerated at the best of times, when they pass across the final time, they become a true menace, the cursed spirit unbound. When the poltergheist dies the final time, they can immediately take the Banshee Role under the guidance of Staff. They will be released for one final life to attempt to right the wrongs that caused their death, and can only be put to rest by fulfilling a specific requirement, which will be negotiated between the character and Staff at the time of their last death.
