  The bitter cold that consumes the spirit of the gheist is sometimes passed onto their foes, a strange supernatural chill that can freeze even the heartiest individualâ€™s bones. The gheist may replace the accent on a melee delivered blow with the accent Ice, at-will. This can be used in conjunction with other powers.
