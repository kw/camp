   Cursed from beyond the veil, the gheist only gains nourishment from the members of their breed. Once per long rest the gheist must feed on a member of their own breed (a creature sharing the same breed qualifiers they have) using the Consume Breed Advantage, if they donâ€™t, upon their next long rest they are Inherently Drained by Hunger until they use the Consume Breed Advantage successfully on a creature that is from their breed. **While drained in this way the gheist may still use the Consume Breed Advantage**. This Challenge is mutually exclusive with **Thy Flesh Consumed**. The gheist must take the **Consume** advantage if this challenge is taken.
