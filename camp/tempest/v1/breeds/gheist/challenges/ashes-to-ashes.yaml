  It is said that most monsters that go bump in the night can be staved off by the swinging of a burning torch or the promise of a Sourcererâ€™s conflagration. This is especially true for the gheist. The gheist has Inherent Vulnerability to Flame, and also takes a Short Taint by Flame when they take flame damage.
