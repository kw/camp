name: Curse of Erasmus
award: 4
requires: -from-dusk-till-dawn
description: |
  As the Grimm swept across the land, and the Lion’s rage nipped at Erasmus’s heels, he invoked the power demanded of him by the Mother of Suffering. His ascension cost his followers greatly. This sacrifice would come to be known as the Curse of Erasmus, and those faithful to the young Witch God’s creed would bear it eternally. The character gains the Inherent Hollow Type, as outlined in the Rulebook. If for any reason the character loses the Hollow Type, they also lose the Breed points gained here, and any associated Perks. This flaw cannot be taken in conjunction with **From Dusk ‘till Dawn**.
