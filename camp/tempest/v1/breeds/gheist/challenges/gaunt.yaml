description: |
  Barely hanging on to what half life they can, the mortal body of the gheist wears its wounds plainly, and is loath to let them go. Gheists tend to be very gaunt, with sunken eyes, cheeks, and pronounced (deeply shaded) bones. They bruise easily, and often bear bruised splotches on their bodies.
