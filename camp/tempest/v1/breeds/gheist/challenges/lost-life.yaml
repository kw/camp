  Lost in the depths of time and memory the past life of the gheist is but a half remembered dream. This gheist cannot Cross-Breed. However, they may choose a physical [Repped] challenge from a single specific breed and earn that amount of Advantage points for Lost Life instead. Any [Repped] tags the disadvantage has is also applied to Lost Life. For instance, if the  Ætori Aelthen “Burning Gaze” breed disadvantage is taken,  Lost Life will be [Repped, Eye Color] and award 4 points.
