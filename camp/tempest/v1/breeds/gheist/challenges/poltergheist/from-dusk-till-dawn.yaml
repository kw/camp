  Cursed to walk the night as a half dead apparition, the Poltergheist’s true form is only apparent after the sun goes down, remaining otherwise inconspicuous during the day.

  The Poltergheist’s Breed Advantages only exist during the night time (7pm to 7am). During the day (7am-7pm) this Character cannot use any Breed Advantages (Or other benefits purchased with Breed Points).  In addition, the poltergheist do not rep any of the following poltergheist Breed Advantages and Disadvantages during the day: Frostbite, Gaunt, Black Nails, Shroud of the Veil, Hidden Shroud, or Dead Eyes. A poltergheist must represent all other Breed Challenges taken by this character.

  During the night, your form and all items you are carrying become slightly out of phase. During this time moving objects becomes harder, and you can only use weapons and armor you were carrying or wearing when you transformed. You cannot move the bodies of other characters, nor can you move game objects that are less than a foot in length, such as treasure, puzzles, written props, and the like. You cannot loot corpses or pick up treasure in the form of coins or tags. You cannot carry plot items such as boxes of food, weapons, or written text props. You can still use spells and skills like First Aid on other characters. You can move doors, furniture, blankets, and similar non-game objects in the environment. You can move food and drink. You can open chests, but you cannot take anything small inside them. Additionally, during this time the character gains the Inherent Hollow Type, as outlined in chapter 3.

  In addition, all poltergheist are inherently Vulnerable to the Madness accent, owing to their death like state.

  The poltergheist must take any combination of the following traits adding up to at least five points. A player may choose to represent additional traits, but will not gain additional benefit for doing so.
