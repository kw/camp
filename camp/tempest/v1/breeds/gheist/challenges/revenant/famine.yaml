  _“Arrows rained down from the Leonholdt forces guarding the fortress. They bounced and clinked against Kaleg’s armor, his breaths slow and labored, but determined. Slow and methodical steps carried him forward. There was a gnawing, endless pit in his stomach that demanded its fill. It would be full soon, for a short while, at least.”_ The Revenant is Inherently Slowed.
