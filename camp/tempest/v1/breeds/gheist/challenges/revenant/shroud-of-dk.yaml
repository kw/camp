description: |
  Revenants do not choose to don the cursed helm of the Revenant- the blackened helm is formed from the shattered ice and remnants of their anguished soul. The Revenant must wear a metal helmet or mask. For the purposes of other Advantages, **Shroud of the Death Knight** counts as **Shroud of the Veil**. If the character removes the helm for any reason, the character loses access to all breed advantages until it is replaced. A character wearing **Shroud of the Death Knight** earns armor points for the helmet as usual.
