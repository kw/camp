name: Gheist
description: |
  _“Hunger and cold. A pit in the stomach that remains unfilled after each meal. A thirst left unquenched after countless waterskins drained. Chilblains that numb from the elbows to the fingertips, freezing to the touch despite the closest source of flame._

  _This curse cuts through my flesh and twists my very soul. There is a hungering pit in my stomach that I can’t shake. I know the ritual was a success. I feel the Witch-God Famine’s power in my blood, but there’s something… else… out there, lurking in the grim. I know I am tied to it. I can feel the hunger that comes from That Dark Place. It festers inside of me, like a ball of writhing worms in my stomach._

  _I cannot give into it. If the beast that urges me into that dark place is some Gluttonous thing, then I will be its foil. I will not let that darkness inside of me._

  _The Grimoire speaks of my condition. It calls us ‘Gheist’, a word from a Grimm language lost to the Tempest. It doesn’t matter what it’s origin, these people, the Gheist, are the ones who stood beside me and helped me share this burden. But I can’t go back. Their suffering is their own, now. They knew the cost to be paid. I have to stop that Hungering Thing, for should its ravenous maw escape the Grimm, I cannot say how the Mortal Breeds will fare._

  _I am no longer Aelthen. I am gheist… And I am so, so hungry._

  ## Description

  Driven by an uncontrollable hunger and desire to fill a cold emptiness, the gheist are a breed born from a supernatural affliction. The curse of the gheist manifests similarly within all of the afflicted, but some are more able to resist its transformations. Identifying a gheist can be difficult: most gheist would rather the world not know of their condition, and therefore hide their blackened, dead flesh behind gauze, masks, or hoods. Some lucky few simply do not manifest such malformations, but instead take on twisted perceptions or modes of thought.

  Gheist always begin their life as another breed, and, through the curse, become gheist. This transformation can completely strip their previous identities: twisting their bodies and minds into the hollow husks of cold and hunger that are often the subject of fearful tales uttered by the common folk. Rarely, gheist simply appear as a Thrylossi or Aelthen might, with only vague peculiarities to betray their true nature to the particularly perceptive around them.

  Gheist often resemble what a lost mountaintop traveler might appear: frost-bitten fingers and extremities, gaunt cheeks, protruding ribs from hunger, eyes milky white and deadened. Be that as it may, they are still very much alive, even if they might well look undead at cursory inspection. The gheist curse manifests within every known breed, and is widely believed to be irreversible.
