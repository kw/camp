  Poltergheist are the polar opposite to the Revenant: while a Revenant has control over their ability to twist the powers that contain the darkness within themselves, poltergheist do not make any such attempt to do so, often reveling in the transformation, and pushing the limits of the curse to take on ever more grotesque mockeries of mortality. Their curse manifests as a powerful transformation, beginning the moment the sun hides away beyond the horizon, stripping the last vestiges of the living flesh away, leaving only spirit.

  During the night, poltergheist are known to be exceptionally difficult to kill, due to their intangible forms. While in this ghostly state, blades, arrows and spells pass harmlessly through their incorporeal bodies, often to the delight of the poltergheist, who often utters a skittering curse or baleful laugh before descending upon the enemy so foolish to attempt the poltergheist harm.
