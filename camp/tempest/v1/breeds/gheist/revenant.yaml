  When discussing the gheist, the themes of hunger and cold are common, but the less discussed theme is control. Most gheist have limited control over their existence, all but ruled by their guttural hunger and the desire to feel “warmth” again, despite even a raging bonfire failing to give even a moment's respite. To most gheist, this is what rules their day to day lives. The curse has re-written their lives to revolve around those concepts, but the same is not true for the Revenant.

  The revenants are, for lack of a better description, gheist who have absolute control over their curse. They are able to twist its profane curse in a way that other gheist cannot hope for, and what allows a revenant to be able to do so is unknown.

  Most revenants are found near the ruins of the Lost Expedition of Leonholdt. It is believed by many scholars that they are somehow spiritually connected to the site of their curse, and are drawn to return there, even when passing through the spirit realms. Their control comes at a cost, however, as control over their hunger forces them deeper and deeper into a pit of famine. They tend to be lumbering and sluggish despite their immense powers granted to them by their control over their curse.
