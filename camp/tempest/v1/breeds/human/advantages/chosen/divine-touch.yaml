  Calling upon one’s divine overseer is often considered the last resort, but for the Chosen, it’s a daily occurrence, and one with a surprisingly reliable result. The character may expend a number of Spikes and Focus for a Quick 100 to heal herself or another character within Touch range for one point per Spike once per Long Rest. The call for this effect is “Heal X by Radiance” where X is the number of Spikes spent.
