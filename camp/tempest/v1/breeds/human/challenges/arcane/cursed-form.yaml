description: |
  Twisted and unhealthy forms are just a part of any Breed, but the Arcane seem especially prone to physical weakness. Perhaps the overdependence on magic in the past warped the lineage, or possibly simply cares not to take care of a flimsy mortal form - expecting to ascend beyond it. The character has -1 Maximum Life Point.
