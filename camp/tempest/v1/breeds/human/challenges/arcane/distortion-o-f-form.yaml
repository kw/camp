  The heritage of the Arcane is such that dependency on the material was seen as a weakness. Many Arcane feel this innately, as armor constricts the movement necessary to cast correctly, and thus make “modifications” to any such armor. Others are simply… stretched in dimensions that makes wearing armor uncomfortable and impracticable. All non-summoned armor has its maximum armor reduced by one, to a minimum of one.
