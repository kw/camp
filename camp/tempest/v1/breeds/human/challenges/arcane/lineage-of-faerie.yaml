description: |
  Sources of Arcane blood are often speculated upon, but must be myriad for all the features that can present themselves. However, it is clear that some lineages are connected to the Fae, as expressions of the Dreamwoven are impossible to miss. The character may take the Fae Blood Flaw from the Character Options Chapter as a Breed Challenge.
