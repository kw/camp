  Good versus evil is a tale as old as time, however, often, it’s better described as light versus dark. When taking this challenge, choose Radiance or Darkness. The character has Vulnerability to their choice and also takes 1 by Spirit whenever they are affected by that accent. If the character has the Divine Vulnerability challenge, they will take “1 by Will” when affected by both the Radiance and Darkness accent, rather than just one.
