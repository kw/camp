  The Chosen knows that they serve a higher calling and is devoted to the service of it. Often these Chosen are set in their ways and cannot be persuaded away from their system of belief no matter what evidence is presented to them. They treat any effects delivered by their religion’s Qualifier (“follower of [Devotion] or The Undevoted”) as Final. In addition, if a player with this challenge breaks one of their religious tenets, they take Final Piercing damage equal to their Maximum Life Point total.
