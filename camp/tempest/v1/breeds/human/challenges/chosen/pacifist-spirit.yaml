name: Pacifist Spirit
award: 3
description: |
  Deep in the Chosen's very being is an urge to protect, nurture, and help. While outwardly capable of defending themselves, their spirit never wants to inflict harm even against an aggressor. Should the character cause another to die, by Power or Deathblow, they take Piercing 3 by Will Final.
