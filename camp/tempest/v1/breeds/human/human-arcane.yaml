short_description: Humans with blood ties to ancient magics.
description: |
  Tracing their blood back to ancient clans of sourcerers, witches, warlocks, and the like, the Arcane simply breathe magic as if it were second nature. The life of an Arcane takes an abrupt turn around the age of ten, as the once human child manifests their innate powers, often in spectacular fashion: tales of childhood homes erupting in flames, bullies having limbs broken by unseen forces, and lost children guided from dark forests by supernatural guidance are common among the Arcane.

  One facet always seems to arise though: the Manifestation begins with some form of childhood trauma: a lost parent, a childhood fight, or the like. None know why this is, but it is eerily consistent, spanning time and locale.

  The price, however, once paid, finds the newly minted Arcane easily able to manipulate magic: it comes naturally, and easily, though there are no guards or rails against exploration into darker paths - many a budding Arcane has found themselves deep in Dark Territory without an inkling of what lurks there.
