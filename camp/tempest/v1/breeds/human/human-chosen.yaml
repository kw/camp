short_description: One related to or watched by the divine.
description: |
  A chosen of the gods, these humans might have angelic or deific blood in their lineage, be the focus of an ancient prophecy, or are watched by one of the gods (for good or for ill). While others may earn the attention of otherworldly patrons in their lifetimes, very few are watched from birth. Most of those who are, claim at least some human descent.

  Chosen are frequently adventurers, finding themselves drawn to risky situations, where their divine blood guides them as an innate luck or intuition. Drawn to promises of grand destinies, power, and fame, few Chosen opt for a quiet life of normalcy, and fewer still the life of the recluse or hermit.

  That said, the futures of Chosen are always in question, as the candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and Chosen often seek to burn as bright as they can, with predictable, if impressive, results.
