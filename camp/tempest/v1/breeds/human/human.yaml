  ## Description

  Humans are by far the most versatile and flexible of all the breeds known to the land. They are natural chameleons and adapt to changing environments and cultures well.

  Known for being highly adaptive to many environments, humans encompass a wide range of cultures, traits, and biomes. This tendency to take on the features of the locale they inhabit has not gone unnoticed to the well-traveled scholar, as humans from one area might look and act almost entirely differently from one another.

  However, some aspects of humanity remain core to the breed, perhaps expressed to a greater or lesser extent, but generally present in each one that you might meet - whether in a hut at the edge of a volcano, deep in an alley at the center of a sprawling city, or alone in a canoe adrift at sea.
