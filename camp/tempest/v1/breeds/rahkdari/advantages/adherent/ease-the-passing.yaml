description: |
  Through the adherent’s devotion to balance and order, they can aid spirits as they pass from this life to the next. To do this, they work to assuage any concerns or anxieties the spirit may have about leaving their body. The adherent ensures the body left behind by the spirit is unsuitable for necromantic magics by placing a sigil on the corpse. After adorning their sigil on the corpse, they may call “Grant Undead Immunity to Corpse.”
