  _“Skarvold was a renowned fighter, known to fell the mightiest of warriors in a single swing. Thus, though Sekshari the Unyielding, another well known combatant, stood before him, he brandished his blade with little care before the crowd. One swift strike later, Skarvold lifted his blade, flourished it in victory, only to hear silence from the onlookers. Sekshari remained, bloodied, but very much alive, and now, Skarvold stood, with his arms raised and back turned to his opponent, while Sekshari readied his own lethal strike.”_ This Character has the Toughness Perk from the Character Options Chapter as a Breed Advantage
