description: |
  The adherent may walk between the worlds to access places they might not normally. This process is not without cost, but can be crucial when the time is right.

  The adherent may Focus for a Quick 100 and then call “Slow 100 Grant Insubstantial to Self.” They then may slowly walk freely. Any time thereafter they may (or once the Slow Count is complete, must) call “Cure Insubstantial to Self.” For every Slow Count of ten, or ten steps the adherent takes while Insubstantial they take Piercing 1 Final when they return. This damage is cumulative, and taken as a single blow upon the call of “Cure Insubstantial to Self.” The Adherent may use this ability once per Long Rest.
