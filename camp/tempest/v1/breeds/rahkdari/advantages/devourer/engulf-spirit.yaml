  Devourers revel in the blood of a kill, and their vengeful spirit within them does as well. Once per short rest, The devourer may Focus for a Quick 100 after successfully completing a deathblow to “Heal One to Self by Hunger” as the devourer’s spirit gorges itself on the release of the spiritual energy of its victim. In addition, they may expend a spike to “Heal Two to self by Hunger” instead.
