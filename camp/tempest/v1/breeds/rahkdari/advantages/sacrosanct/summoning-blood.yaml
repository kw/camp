  The sacrosanct understands that the flesh and spirit are two halves of a whole, and one may be traded for the other, in precise measure. When the sacrosanct is the primary ritualist on binding or summoning Rituals that require Resources, the sacrosanct may cut themselves, draining two Life Points into the Ritual in place of one Resource. This can only be done once per Ritual.
