  An adherent will feel pangs of spiritual discordance each day until they leave an offering of two wealth or one Harvest to pay homage to the local spirits. As long as the homage is not paid, the connection to spirits weakens and loses access to all rahkdari Breed Advantages. This homage is to be left at the shrine to the ancestors. When leaving an offering at their shrine, the Rahkdari should remove any previous offerings and place them in the nearest Ashbin. This challenge may only be taken if the character also has taken the Rahkdari General Challenge Keeping the Connection.
