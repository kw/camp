  Upon arriving in a new land, and at the beginning of each event, the rahkdari must take time to set up a shrine to honor the local spirits. This shrine must be adorned with offerings or symbols important to the rahkdari. If the shrine is defiled, or the Rahkdari fails to set it up appropriately, the rahkdari will be incapable of taking Short Rests until the Shrine is (re)constructed or the next long rest, whichever comes first. The Rahkdari must visit this shrine to gain the benefits of their Long Rest.
