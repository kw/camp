  The rahkdariâ€™s connection to the spirit world is strong, arguably too strong. These rahkdari are said to already have one foot in the grave. The Rahkdari cannot take the Carnal Creature, the Will to Live, or the Holding On Character Advantages. When the rahkdari takes a Death Blow or a Death Effect, they instead take a Death Final Effect.
