description: |
  _“Ithejaro the Ruiner stood, a stark image against the moonlight. Three arcs of ivory in the night: his silvered khopesh, the ivory horn that graced his forehead, and bone-hued moon over his shoulder.”_ In rare cases, sacrosancts will manifest a single, large crescent-shaped horn of 5” or larger.
