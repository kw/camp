  Balance. Order. The Adherent seeks to quell the battle raging within themselves by bringing balance to the world around them. To the adherent, the spirit and the physical must be brought once again into harmony if either is to thrive. They often pledge themselves in service to the spirits of whatever lands they find themselves residing within, working to put an end to disturbances and hardships that are so often caused by mortal hands. These services are generally in exchange for boons offered to them in addition to the spiritual essence they need to survive.

  This close association has allowed the adherents unparalleled closeness with the spirit world, to the point where many adherents feel more comfortable being a part of the world of the dead then they do with that of the living. As such, it is not uncommon for the adherent to be found seeking the solace and quiet of the local spirit shrines.
