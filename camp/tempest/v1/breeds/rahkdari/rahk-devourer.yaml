parent: rahkdari
description: |
  Freedom. Individuality. The  devourers are perhaps the most obvious manifestation of the rahkdariâ€™s turbulent past: they are often more ghastly in appearance than their kin, their physical bodies warped by generations of soul eating and blasphemous ritual. It is no surprise then that devourers have developed skill sets that are particularly useful for combat and the subjugation of lesser spirits.

  While an individual devourer may be regarded as loathsome by those who would balk at their methods, the efficacy of their tactics cannot be denied. For indeed the devourer is no slave to its family heritage nor is it chained to the Great Sprits. A devourer simply takes what it needs, feeding directly from the spirits it is able to conquer and is free to take destiny into its own hands. For better or worse.
