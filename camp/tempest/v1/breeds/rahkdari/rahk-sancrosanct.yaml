  Tradition. Heritage. The sacrosanct often claim to be descendants of rahkdari kings or glorious heroes or other notable or important bloodlines. The sacrosanct reject the notion that their fates are bound to the Great Spirits of the world, instead trusting their devotion to their own Ancestors and the individual legacies they represent. They refuse to lose touch with their old ways, using their unique connection to the Spirit Realms to draw upon the strengths and knowledge of their Ancestors to reinforce their own. As the sacrosanct draws upon their own Ancestor spirits for strength and sustenance over the course of a lifetime, they slowly often find themselves manifesting traits those spirits had exhibited during their own lives.

  The greater and more storied the sacrosanct becomes in life, the stronger the bond with their bloodlineâ€™s dynasty will become. By becoming conduits for the ancient heroes and patrons of their past, the sacrosanct strives to build a better future for their kin and ensure their combined legacy lives on.
