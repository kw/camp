  Created from materials beyond the veil, the Arbitersâ€™ connection with magic goes beyond most mortals, creating linkages impossible for other breeds.

  You may gain an additional Signature attunement slot, however the enchanted item must have the Ruin, Death, Power or Tempus aspect, or require one of those Foundation Resources by name for every Enchantment or Ritual on it.
