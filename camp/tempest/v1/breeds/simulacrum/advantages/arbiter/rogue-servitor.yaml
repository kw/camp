  Masters of creation, the divine sources of Arbiters impart some of this skill onto their creations, allowing them to siphon pure maelstrom into their rituals. Once per Long Rest when this character is the Primary Ritualist, the character may replace instances of a basic resource required for the ritual, by increasing the Dark Territory by one. Additionally the character may replace a Ritual Wand by increasing the Dark Territory by 3 and/or a Ritual Powder by increasing the Dark Territory by 6.  This may be used to substitute any number of these types of resources in a single ritual, adding additional Dark Territory to the ritual result.  The character may never increase the dark territory with this skill by more than double the number of ranks of the appropriate ritual skill (Arcane or Divine).  This skill has no effect on Enchanting, Tinkering, or Alchemy even if Dark Territory is involved.
