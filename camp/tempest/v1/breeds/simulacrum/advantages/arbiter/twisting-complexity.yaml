  The arbiters are no stranger to the Tempest, and wherever they may go, they cannot stray far enough to be without its guidance. Whenever this Character is not in the world they are originally from, they count as having the Sensitive Perk from the Character Options Chapter. This includes passing through a stormgate, or traveling to another chapter.
