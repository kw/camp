  While the wings of the Celestine do not grant flight, as those of the angels do, they are not entirely without merit. This Character has Resistance to the effects of Falling. In addition, the character has the Agility Perk as a Breed Advantage from the Character Options Chapter. This Advantage can only be taken if the Character has the Cast in the Image Breed Challenge.
