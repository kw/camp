name: Embrace the Light
cost: 8
description: |
  The essence of all that is light, is also holy, and so those cast from the font of the divine need not fear while the one true radiance shines upon them. From 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM this Character cannot bleed out normally from their death-count Timer. However, if a Death Blow is used on the character, this ability will fail to function until they are stabilized or have at least 1 Life Point.
