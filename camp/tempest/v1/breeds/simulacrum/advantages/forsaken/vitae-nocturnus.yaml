description: |
  The darkness embraces the Forsaken, holding them close, and cradling even the most injured, guarding them from death. From 7:00 PM to 7:00AM this Character cannot bleed out normally from their Bleed-Out Timer. This does not mean they cannot move to their death timer from a Damage, Death Effect, or Death Blow.
