  Creations from beyond the veil that separates our worlds from the Tempest, the Arbiters origin is hazy at best, and rife with rumor and speculation. Crafted much like other simulacra, they often bear a mark signifying their creator, but none have yet been able to decipher them, nor are the Arbiters themselves either aware or at least willing to share.

  What is known is that the Arbiters all share an unusual affinity for the Maelstrom, some even growing stronger after leaving our world, passing through Stormgates, or contacting the Dark.
