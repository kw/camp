name: Celestine
type: subbreed
parent: simulacrum
description: |
  As with all other simulacra, the Celestine is designed with some divine goal in mind, though it may never be known by anyone other than its divine maker. However, some features appear consistent enough to group them together: a paleness that suffuses their eyes and flesh, flecked with metallic gold, and often a marked preference or emission of an internal light that carries with them everywhere.
