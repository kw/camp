  Built from unknowable substances beyond the realms we inhabit, the flesh of the arbiters seems no different than any others, until one pays close attention. This Character must represent having different shades of purples and blues portraying the seams of a mask around the contours of the face and broken lines representing “mask” is broken. If instead the player chooses to rep this challenge with an actual mask representing this trait, this challenge awards 4 points.
