  Cast from some unknowable font of divine materials, celestineâ€™s flesh can often show the construction of the material they were built from. This character must represent having seams at any exposed skin where the following major joints are: shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, ankle. The joints should be highlighted in metallic gold, and shadowed like a mannequin or doll.
