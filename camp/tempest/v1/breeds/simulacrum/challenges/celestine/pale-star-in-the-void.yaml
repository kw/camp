  The flesh of the celestine is rumored to be “light, condensed into flesh”, and so it is with this celestine: the darkness robs them of vitality. The character must represent a separate mark (that meets the **Makers Mark** Breed Challenge criteria) on the back of their hand, as well as whenever they are hit with an attack with the Darkness Accent they take “1 Darkness” as an additional effect.
