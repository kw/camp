  Cast in darkness, rumor has it that the Forsaken’s eyes glow in the dark, but surely it’s only the fiery coloration, which is unnerving enough. In addition, this coloration must extend to eyeshadow and eyeliner of the other color selection (Red eyes, Black eyeshadow / Black eyes, Red eyeshadow). This Character must make their eyes appear red or black with eye contacts. This Challenge can be taken only for colors outside the range of human coloring.
