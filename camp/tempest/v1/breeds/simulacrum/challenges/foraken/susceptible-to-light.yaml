  Lore has it that the Forsaken are constructed in a place with no name, and in total darkness, as the flesh they are carved from melts away in the light. The character must represent a separate mark (that meets the **Makers Mark** Breed Challenge criteria) on the back of their hand, as well as whenever you are hit with an attack with the Radiance Accent you take “1 Radiance” as an additional effect.
