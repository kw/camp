  As crafted beings, the simulacra often bear the mark of their creator, whether it be as a mark of the artists’ pride, proclaiming ownership, or as a warning to others. The Character must represent the marking of one of the Deities (or variation thereof) scarred, stamped, tattooed, or branded somewhere on their face in at least a 2” by 2” square or larger. Other maker’s marks may be approved at the discretion of the Staff.

  **Note**: Many entities have existing designs, and simplification or variation on the established design is allowed, as long as the relationship is clear.
