description: |
  The Forsaken, derived from Divine visions of some unknowable underworld, occasionally appear in the world of Tempest. They are often guided by some deific imposition to scour the lands of errant souls, but are just as likely as any other simulacra to be afflicted by the urge to live out mortal lives.

  Those that do attempt to live among mortals often find themselves at disadvantage attempting to do so: the forms they were crafted with lend an air of unease, and communities trust for them is a scant commodity.

  The features that mark them as Forsaken, often  include fiery tones, a preference for dark, shadowy corners, and demon-like horns and tails, resulting in forms reminiscent of tales to scare children, and encourage mobs of angry townsfolk.
