name: Simulacrum
description: |
  _“As messengers, warriors, and voices of the gods, the simulacra come in a variety of shapes and forms, some barely recognizable as a being unto itself, presenting as whirling balls of energy and windswept detritus._

  _Those that do mimic the forms of humans or aelthen, however, are crafted with a specific purpose: to commune with us and evangelize the will of their patrons. However, there are those who are either tasked with goals and ambitions we don’t understand, or are imbued with a sort of free will we normally associate with the mortals of the Tempest._

  _Those few that show this behavior are a mystery to us, as they speak as though they are one of us, and it’s impossible to know whether they are simply attempting to instill trust as an avatar of their deity, or are actually present as a member of society - but, I suppose, no one can know that aspect about any of us, mortal or otherwise.”_

  ## Description

  Constructs of the Divine, simulacrum are the will of the gods made manifest. Each is tasked with a goal or mission which, once carried out, seems to end with the obliteration of the Simulacrum. Its job done, it is disposed of and returned to the clay of creation it came from.

  However, some appear, for all intents and purposes, to be members of the community living out seemingly normal lives. It is unknown if these have strayed from their masters grip, or some sort of free will was bestowed upon them in the past. Deepening the mystery, few if any of these can tell you which it might be as most if not all have lost the reason why this has happened.

  What is known is that the simulacra are shaped and designed with purpose, often etched with the divine maker upon its flesh for all to see.
