    This Power blesses water in a standard sized container (no more than 16 oz) for a Slow 60. Upon completion of the incant, the caster chooses a condition out loud, and is cured of that condition. For each other person that drinks from the container within that time, the caster may cure that one Condition. This will not work on the Imprisoned effect, as the water cannot be ingested by the imprisoned creature.
