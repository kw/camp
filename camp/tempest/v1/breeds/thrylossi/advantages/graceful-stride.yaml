description: |
  Some Thrylossi find a certain surety in their gait, as if the Worldsoul guides their very steps as they go out and explore the worlds. The Character has Resistance to Root and is generally unhindered by naturally thick-forested environments such as natural vines, undergrowth and swampy terrain. (Marshalâ€™s discretion) This will last until the character has resisted a number of these Effects equal to their Maximum Life Points, and only refreshes at the beginning of each event.
