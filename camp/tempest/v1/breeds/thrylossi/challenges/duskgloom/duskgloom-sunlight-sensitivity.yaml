  Duskgloom are often much more used to the dark forests and night that blanket the world, to a point where their existence has been altered by the Worldsoul to be more comfortable in the dark. Due to this they tend to cover at least 90% of their skin and wear some kind of eye protection during the day, but donâ€™t feel the need to at night. If the Duskgloom Thrylossi is not covered and wearing some sort of eye protection during the day they will be Inherently _Drained_ until they cover their skin once more or return to a place with no sunlight.
