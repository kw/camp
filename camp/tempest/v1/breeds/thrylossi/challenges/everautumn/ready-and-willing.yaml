  Some Everautumnâ€™s connections to the Worldsoul are so strong that they start to take on traits from it. These Thrylossi often think in terms of community first: often are ready to help at a moment's notice and listen to what they are told. The Character has the Pliant Flaw from the Character Options Chapter as a Breed Challenge.
