  Often Thrylossi are tied to the Worldsoul on a fundamental level and hold it in great reverence, thus they try to leave small gifts for the natural world when they can. Duskgloom will tend to give blessings when the sun falls below the horizon and Dawnbloom will try to leave blessings at the first light of day, and those who are neither tend to pick a favorite.
