name: Duskgloom
type: subbreed
parent: thrylossi
description: |
  The Duskgloom are often perceived as reclusive, mysterious creatures with ghostly horns and a reluctance to leave the deepest shrouds of the forest. While the Dawnbloom and Everautumn Thyrlossi stalwartly manifest traits relating to the blooming of life, the Duskgloom manifest traits on the opposite spectrum. They are at home to the Darkness and gloom of the death end of the cycle.
