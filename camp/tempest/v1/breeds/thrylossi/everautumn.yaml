description: |
  The Everautumn are typically the most recent to wander from the Everautumn (or perhaps those who have returned there for some time, and ventured forth again), and appear to have the strongest physical manifestations of the Worldsoul. They often have orange hair and eyes, and have strong connections to the metaphysical bond of the Worldsoul.
