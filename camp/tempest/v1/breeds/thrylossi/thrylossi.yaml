  ## Description

  The Thrylossi are mythical creatures born of a small demi-realm known as Everautumn. There, a powerful font of life, known as the Worldsoul, extends out and touches the mortal planes and many beings across those planes. Through this link, the Thrylossi are able to wander into the mortal planes, led by their own curiosity.

  Thrylossi are an impressively long-lived race, though they don’t tend to have much memory beyond forty or so years, leaving them in a state of constant wonder at the worlds they inhabit, though not naive in the ways of life. Interestingly, the longer the Thyrlossi spend outside of the Everautumn, the more human-like they become, though none know why.
