  This power taps into a deeper understanding of the leylines of magic. When cast, the Arcanist may use each of these Discerns once against any valid target before a Long Rest. If the Discern is
  Prevented (“Counter”, “No Effect”), the specific Discern Prevented regains its charge, and may be used against another valid target.  Once this Cantrip is cast again, all remaining questions from
  the previous casting are lost.
