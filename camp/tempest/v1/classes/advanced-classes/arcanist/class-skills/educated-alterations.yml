description: |
  While the Arcanist is a Primary Ritualist in an Arcane Ritual, they may add or remove Dark Territory from the final tally by a number equal to up to half their Arcanist class-level, rounded up. Thus, a fifth level Arcanist could add or remove up to three Dark Territory.

  Note: You will need to notify your Marshal at the time you use this power.
