  While the Arcanist is a Primary Ritualist in an Enchanting Ritual, they may add or remove Dark Territory from the final tally up to half their Arcanist class-level, rounded down. Thus, a fifth level Arcanist could add or remove up to two Dark Territory.

  Note: You will need to notify your Marshal at the time you use this power.
