  The Arcanist is a master of special spells and utility magics, allowing them to perform amazing feats that other casters can only dream of. Between each Long Rest, the Arcanist can bookcast a number of Spells equal to their Arcanist class-level that have the [Arcane Tool] tag without exhausting Spell-Slots. In addition, the Arcanist adds four ranks of the Bookcaster skill which must be used on Spells with the [Arcane Tool] tag, and adds two more ranks every time they go up in Arcanist level that have the same restriction.

  When the Arcanist reaches level 5, they may Bookcast by reading the incant only once, instead of five times.
