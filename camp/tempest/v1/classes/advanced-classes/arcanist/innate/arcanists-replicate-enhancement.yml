description:
  When casting a non-damaging touch spell, the number of targets is increased by one. The Spell must have a target of Individual, Shield, or Armor, and the listed Delivery must be Touch (Spell-Packet
  or Spell-Ball Spells cast as Touch do not get this benefit).  If the character has the Replicate Enhancement Power, this can be used to increase the number of targets by one.
