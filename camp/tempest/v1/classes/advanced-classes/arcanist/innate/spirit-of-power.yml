  The Arcanist calls on all the powers of the universe to truly live in power for a short time. Until they complete their next Long Rest, they may cast Novice and Adept Arcane Tool Spells without expending
  Spell-Slots and they need only use “Powercast [Name of Spell]” as the Incantation.

  Additionally, once per event, the Arcanist may change a non-offensive touch spell to be delivered verbally through a “By My Voice” Delivery.
