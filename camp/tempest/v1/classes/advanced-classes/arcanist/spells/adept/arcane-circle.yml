description: |
  This spell must be cast while inside a white cord, rope, or the like that is no longer than 20 feet long that has been laid down to make a continuous shape (usually a circle). At the completion of the
  Incantation, the lain rope cannot be purposefully moved by anyone other than the caster, and anyone who attempts to do so should be informed by use of “Instruction: You may not move the rope.” or similar.
  This does not prevent people from crossing the threshold of the cord, rope, or the like.

  Should the rope be moved purposefully by the caster, the spell ends. As long as the caster is completely inside the circle, they have immunity to all Effects and Damage.

  If the caster uses a Power on anyone who has both feet outside the Circle, causes damage to another creature, the caster steps out of the Circle, or the Caster completes a Short Rest the immunity granted
  by the Circle is removed. In addition, they must pick up the circle and end the spell. The Circle can be Dispelled by Dispel Magic and similar magic.

  Note: The caster may only have one Circle active at any given time, regardless of origin.
