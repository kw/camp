  This Spell transfers the knowledge of a weapon’s use into the mind of the target individual. The caster must be able to both touch the intended weapon and the target individual of the spell. Until that
  individual completes a Long Rest, they will be able to use weapons of that type as if they were proficient.

  Note: A spellcaster cannot target themselves with this spell. This spell may be used only once per Target per Long Rest.
