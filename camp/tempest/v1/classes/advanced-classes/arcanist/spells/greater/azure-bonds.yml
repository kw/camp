  The Arcanist gains the power to restrain the movements of those that would cause them ill. Upon completing this spell, the caster gains a pool of 10 Azure Bonds. Each one will do Quick Root by Arcane and is held within a Spell-Packet which must be charged with the words "Azure Bonds."

  In addition, the Arcanist may expend a Spike to alter one of these Calls to “Quick Weakness by Arcane.”

  Finally, the Arcanist may Sacrifice a Novice spell-slot to refresh two Azure Bonds.

  This spell ends when the Arcanist completes a Short Rest or is rendered Helpless.
