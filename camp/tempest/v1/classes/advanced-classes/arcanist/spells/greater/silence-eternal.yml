description: |
  For most common spellcasters, the ropes of the arcane flow from the world into the body. Arcanists know how to pluck those ropes of magic away from their adversariesâ€¦ and tie them to the floor with them.

  By expending a Spike, the target is affected by both Silence and Root by Arcane as their ability to cast spells is snatched away from them.
