description: |
  This Spell can only be cast on an Individual in or on a bed, cot, hammock, or other piece of equipment meant specifically for sleep. The Spell lasts until used, until the character leaves the bed, or until
  the bed moves from its current location. If Bookcast, Good Night does not exhaust a Spell-Slot.

  Note: This effect is subtle, and most often will most often be used when waking up in the morning and finding out via a note from Plot that a monster has deathblowed your entire cabin while you were asleep.
  In this instance, tell Plot at the Spirit Well that you had this effect active when you go to the Spirit Well in the morning.
