  description: |
    The character can only use this ability after moving off to a location removed from combat. They then go insubstantial and can return to the battle and collect Spell-Packets or Spell-Balls. Once they
    have collected a maximum of six, they must return to their original location and Cure their insubstantial Condition by calling "Cure Insubstantial". While insubstantial the character can do nothing
    besides collect Materia and return.

    Note: The character need not be able to use Materia in order to go collect it.
