description: |
  Upon completion of a Contract (as per Contract Killing), the Assassin may revel in their success by buying a round of drinks with friends, teammates, or other individuals in the know (place ten wealth in the Ash Bin). Should they do so, they may choose to benefit from a Long Rest. This Power cannot be Refreshed.

  Additionally, once per Event even if they have not completed a Contract, the Assassin may refresh a Basic or Advanced Assassin power if they are in an assassination Contract.
