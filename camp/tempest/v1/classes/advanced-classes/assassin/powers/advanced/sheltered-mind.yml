description:
  The Assassinâ€™s line of work requires a certain amount of discretion, and some practice a rhyme or mantra to clear their minds when under the scrutiny of the law or other opposition. For a Short Rest, they may choose to answer Discerns that would incriminate the Assassin, uncover a secret, or put them in danger with any answer they desire, and need not indicate that this power was used. This Obfuscate does not protect against Expose Effects.
