  Even the wittiest interrogator will be dazzled by an Assassin's confident words… if only for a short while.

  It’s not about outrunning the bear, it’s about outrunning your friend who’s slower than you. Assassins have mastered the tactic of getting out of town when the coins are down. After explaining they could not have possibly done the thing (that they likely did) for a Quick 30 and provided a somewhat believable excuse (“Couldn't have been me, I was blind that day. Eyes got eaten by birds. It was the one armed man!”), the Assassin may force their victims to believe their lie long enough for them to escape unharmed.
