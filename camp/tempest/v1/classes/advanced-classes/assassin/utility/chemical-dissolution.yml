description: |
  The Assassin’s work is rarely a welcome one for others, and disposal of evidence is often necessary to ensure the secrecy of the job. The Assassin may quickly produce a vial, jar, or other vessel, and roleplay covering a corpse with caustic liquid for a Focus Quick 30. When they have completed this RP, they may call “Shatter to Corpse by Acid,” causing the target to dissipate.
