description: |
  Knowing a target’s weaknesses is fundamental to planning an attack. The more that is known, the better the outcome is likely to be. By engaging the mark beforehand, important information can be gleaned.

  Out of Combat, The Assassin may ask the following Subtle Discerns (once per Long Rest):

    * “Are you immune or resistant to the Poison Accent?”
    * “What are your Maximum Life Points?”
    * “Can you cast Spells or Cantrips?”

  In addition, on an staffed encounter, such as a mod, before the encounter begins you may ask the Lantern Spirit each of these (once per Long Rest):

    * “Lethal Intuition: Are there traps present in this encounter?”
    * “Lethal Intuition: Do I sense the presence of poison in the area?”
    * “Lethal Intuition: Are there other entrances I should know about?“
