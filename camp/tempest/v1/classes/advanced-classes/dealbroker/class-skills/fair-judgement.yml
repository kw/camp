description: |
  Judges, lawyers, and others who must make hard calls often find that an amicable result is not always possible; in a trial or other dispute resolution, one side or
  the other is generally going to leave unhappy. In such situations, the Dealbroker may use Fair Judgement instead of Win-Win.

  Fair Judgement follows the same procedure and requirements as Win-Win, but with a different Incantation and Expose call:

    * At the start of the negotiation, you must say “I stake my reputation on a fair judgment”, or reply “As do I” to another Dealbroker saying the same.
    * At the end of the negotiation, you must call “By My Voice to parties in this negotiation, Expose Final: Anyone who feels this result is unfair.”

  The resulting effects on the Dealbroker are the same as with Win-Win. This counts as a “happy” or “unhappy” use of Win-Win for the purposes of other powers that grant you benefits or consequences based on the outcome of Win-Win unless otherwise noted in those powers.
