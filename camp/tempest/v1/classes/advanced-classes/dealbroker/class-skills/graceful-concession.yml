description:
  Negotiation does not have to be about conflict, and your even temper allows minor disagreements to flow naturally like a stream around a rock. When you
  are asked to make a concession in a negotiation, you may ask for modifications to it up to twice and still benefit from Give and Take if the Dealbroker
  then accepts the request, with or without your requested modifications.
