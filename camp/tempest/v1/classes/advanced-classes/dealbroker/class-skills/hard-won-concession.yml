description:
  Shrewd opponents may notice that a Dealbroker benefits from the smooth flow of requests and concessions and may try to make things harder for you with unnecessary
  friction. You, however, revel in this sort of conflict and wearing down your opponent gives you great satisfaction. Once per Short Rest, when your opponent rebuffs
  a requested concession and further attempts to make it more reasonable to them at least three times and they eventually agree to it, you may refresh all [Concession] powers.
