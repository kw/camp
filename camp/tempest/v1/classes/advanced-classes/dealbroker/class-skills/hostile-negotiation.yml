  Whenever you would benefit from Give and Take, you may Refresh a Spike instead of a [Concession] power. The number of Spikes that can be refreshed in this way is
  limited to your Maximum Spikes total per Short Rest.

  Additionally, you may use Dealbroker powers with an incantation of Negotiation that normally require you to be out of combat even during combat, so long as your
  target is actually engaging in your negotiation.
