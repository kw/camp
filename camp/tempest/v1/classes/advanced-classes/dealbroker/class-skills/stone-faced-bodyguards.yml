description: |
  Negotiators sometimes employ trusted bodyguards, but a keen opponent can take advantage of that and read things in the facial expressions of a too-informed
  bodyguard. A Dealbroker must carefully train their bodyguards not to give anything away during negotiations, or if captured while performing duties elsewhere.

  After explaining the importance of controlling facial expressions, and explaining this Power and the required Call, the Dealbroker may call “Short Grant [X]
  Counters vs Discern by Mind to Bodyguard” on one or more of their bodyguards within touch range, where [X] is their Dealbroker class-level. Their call
  is “Counter, Stone-Faced.”
