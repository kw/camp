description: |
  A negotiation ebbs and flows as demands are made and the participants clash or come to agree. When their opponent allows an opening, a shrewd dealbroker knows how to direct that flow in their favor.
  However, it’s also possible to lure in an opponent by making an opening of your own.

  During any negotiation, if either:

    * Your opponent concedes a condition you requested without modification.
    * You concede a requested condition without modification.

  …you may immediately refresh a single power tagged [Concession] of your choice. You may only benefit from this refresh once per minute of negotiation RP. The condition must be something meaningful;
  asking for the other party to remember to stay hydrated or give a review of their seat cushions is insufficient, and you should not begin a meaningless negotiation for the purpose of refreshing powers.
  If you refresh a power that could also be triggered by the same concession, you may use it immediately and do not need an additional minute of negotiation RP to activate it.
