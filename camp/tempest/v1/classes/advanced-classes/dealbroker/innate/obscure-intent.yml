description: |
  You become Obfuscated versus Discerns with the Mind Accent for the first five questions leveled at you during a negotiation. After that you must expend a Spike to gain the condition again. Each time
  you expend a Spike in this manner, the cost to refresh the Obfuscation goes up by one.

  For Example: Norbert, the well-known dealmaker, is in negotiation for a large sum of construction materials. Over the course of the negotiation, the other side uses several Discerns to suss out
  Norbert’s true intentions, which he naturally Obfuscates. However, once those defenses were exhausted, Norbert silently expends a spike to refresh them. The next time he runs out the Refresh will
  cost two Spikes. He best conclude the negotiations before the cost to refresh exceeds his Maximum Spikes.

  As long as you are Obfuscated by this power, you may choose to have Immunity to a single Discern of your choice. You may use this Immunity to defend against a single Discern Final by calling “No
  Effect, Immune.”

  This power lasts until the end of your current negotiation. It refreshes and activates immediately at the start of your next negotiation.
