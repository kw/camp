  You have an uncanny ability to obtain just the right piece of information at just the right time. While you are in a negotiation out of combat, you may add the Final modifier to any single Discern or Subtle Discern you use on someone participating in or observing the negotiation.

  The Dealbroker may use this ability five times per Long Rest.
