description: |
  You have connections in many places, and they give you discounts on certain services. Whenever you use a power, skill, or a service at an NPC building that requires an expenditure of Wealth due
  to fees, the amount of Wealth required is halved (round up), with a maximum savings per use of 10 Wealth. Fee reduction benefits do not stack with other means of fee reduction — use the best source
  instead.

  For Example: you can’t benefit from the clause of the Rogue power Back Alley Deals that halves its cost and Reduced Fees at the same time. This only applies to fees — if the power, skill, or
  building allows you to purchase something with Wealth, the cost is not affected. This power does not affect direct negotiation with other characters, even if they are NPCs.
