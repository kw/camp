  While it’s hard to pull off, with training you can glean more from someone’s barest introductions than they might otherwise imagine could be gleaned. During a negotiation you are participating in
  or observing out of combat, you may Subtle Discern one of the following questions from anyone participating in or observing the negotiation:

    * What do you hope to achieve with this negotiation?
    * What could I offer you that would change your mind?
    * Who could I threaten that would change your mind?

  Additionally, with the correct probing, it’s possible for the Dealbroker to identify someone who isn’t a mere mark, but with this technique it isn’t possible to avoid revealing yourself as well. Once per Long Rest, you may use:

    * Discern Final: Are you currently able to Obfuscate Discerns?
