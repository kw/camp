  A proper negotiator knows the social etiquette of various cultures and can use this experience to quickly recognize and cover up minor faux pas, prevent an ally from spilling a secret, or create
  other distractions.

  If you say something or perform some action that you regret someone else saw, within a few seconds you may quickly cover it up. Depending on the situation, you may use Voice or Verbal targeting to
  select one, multiple, or all people present and call “[By My Voice/Name or Description]: Obey: You didn’t [see/hear] <That>”, where <That> might literally be “that”, or a short description of the
  information you hope to prevent memory of.

  You may also use this on behalf of someone else, but must exclaim or otherwise draw attention towards yourself before activating this.

  This may only be used to cover for things that you believe to be accidental. For example, if you or an ally take out a big bottle of poison and dramatically poison the drink of the person you are
  speaking with while they watch you do it, this is a deliberate action and you must not use this power. However, if you attempt to sleight-of-hand some poison into a beverage and simply get caught,
  this is a legitimate time to use this power.
