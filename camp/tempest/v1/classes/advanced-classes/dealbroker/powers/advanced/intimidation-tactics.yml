description: |
  Sometimes you need a little push to get a negotiation rolling, and sometimes you just need to get the last word. During a negotiation, include some threatening or frustrated roleplay of some kind,
  and call one of:

    * “[Name or Description]: Obey by Fear, give a reasonable condition for this request.”
    * “[Name or Description]: Obey by Fear, offer a reasonable concession to your request.”
    * “[Name or Description]: Obey by Fear, give a lower price.”

  You can’t benefit from Give and Take from a concession earned in this way.

  Alternatively, you may expend this power to Counter a Fear effect used on you during a negotiation by calling “Counter, Intimidation Tactics.”
