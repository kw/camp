description: |
  Sometimes, an obvious trick works best. During a negotiation out of combat, if the target requests a concession and you both immediately accept it and also throw in some meaningful bonus, and the target accepts your addition, you may then call “[Name or Description]: Short Charm by Will” on the negotiator who requested the concession.
