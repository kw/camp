  Not all schemes can be enacted quickly; sometimes you need to set the perfect conditions. To be able to activate this power, you must complete a negotiation with the following conditions:

    * The intended target must be either an opposing negotiator, or a specific individual who they are negotiating on behalf of, who is present for and observing the negotiation. The opposing negotiator can be in on the con.
    * The negotiation must begin by activating your Win-Win power.
    * After the negotiation’s conclusion, the target must not indicate they are dissatisfied with the result of the Win-Win Expose call (though the overall result does not need to be positive).

  If all of these conditions are cleared, at some point before the end of the following month (generally, until the end of the next event), after some brief roleplay where you remind them of your previous
  positive dealings, you may call on the target your choice of:

    * “[Name or Description]: Subtle Charm by Mind”
    * “[Name or Description]: Short Dominate by Mind”

  You lose this opportunity if, in the intervening time, the target expresses anger towards you or attempts to attack you, you attempt to attack the target, you forget that this event has occurred, or you
  are involved in another negotiation with the target where they express dissatisfaction (whether or not Win-Win was invoked).
