description: |
  While extracting the truth out of a skilled opponent can be nearly impossible, spotting attempts to obfuscate the truth may unsettle the target enough to disrupt their focus. During a negotiation out of
  combat, immediately after using a Discern or Expose on someone involved in the negotiation, you may immediately call against them:

    > “[Name or Description]: Subtle Discern by Mind Final: Did you Obfuscate my previous [Discern/Expose]?”

  If the answer is “Yes” or equivalent, you may then call:

    > “[Name or Description]: Dispel Obfuscated by Mind”

  The shrewd Dealbroker should note that a tricky opponent may have multiple powers that Obfuscate, and may activate one after their previous Obfuscated condition has been used up or Dispelled.
  Additionally, this will not remove an Inherent Obfuscated Condition.
