  When things get rough during a negotiation, a veteran Dealbroker has already planned their exit strategy. First, arrange for a distraction to occur - this might involve signaling an ally to cause a ruckus, setting off a mechanical noisemaker, waiting for a distraction to occur naturally, or if all else fails, bluffing it (“Look! A distraction!”). Depending on how dangerous a situation is, a distraction that is actually effective may allow you to get your next Call off successfully, but the distraction only needs to be attempted to use this Power.

  Once your opponents are (hopefully) distracted, you may Call “By My Voice, Quick Obey By Will: Do not attack or pursue anyone who does nothing but leave”. You may raise your voice, but do not shout it — this technique is effective for extracting a small party, not disrupting an entire field battle.

  For the next Slow 180, as long as you do not attack anyone and do nothing else but leave (that is, you don’t attempt to steal an item, stop to read a scroll, or other non-leaving activities), you may call “[Name or Description]: Quick Root by Will” against anyone who attacks, pursues, or otherwise tries to hinder your escape. You may use this at-will during the Slow 180 count, but no more than once per opponent.
