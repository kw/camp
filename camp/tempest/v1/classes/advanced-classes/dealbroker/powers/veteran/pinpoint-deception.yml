description: |
  Dealbrokers tend to have a highly-trained sense of attempts to deceive. During a negotiation out of combat, you may ask: “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern by Mind: What have you lied about during this negotiation?”.

  If you use it again during the same negotiation on the same target (for example, if you use Give and Take to Refresh it), the call changes to: “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern by Mind: What is one thing you have lied about since I last asked?”

  Even if Refreshed, you can only use this power on any given target once per Short Rest.
