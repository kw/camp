description:
  Dealbrokers know how to keep their coin safe in the face of muggers or thieves trying to negotiate on false pretenses. You may designate one pouch (no more than 8‚Äù in any one dimension) as your
  Coinpurse. The Coinpurse can only contain Wealth, though you may keep it in multiple smaller containers within the Coinpurse for convenience. Once marked with a Halo Sigil, the contents of the purse
  are immune to searches and Powers and are excluded when answering Discern questions. The power does not need to be announced, and can be ignored by the Dealbroker.
