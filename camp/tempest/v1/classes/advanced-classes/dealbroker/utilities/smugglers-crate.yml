description: |
  You may place a container somewhere, then hide it by placing red card with a white halo on it that reads:

  > Hidden by <your name>
  > Sight: You know this is here, but may not interact with it.
  > Sight Beyond Sight: You may interact normally with this object, but if you move it, also remove this card.

  You are able to find and interact with a crate that you have hidden yourself even without Sight Beyond Sight, but must still remove the card if you move it. You
  should check that your original card is still present before interacting with it. A Smuggler’s Crate may have additional protections added using other items or
  powers such as locks, traps, or the Socialite’s Safebox power.
