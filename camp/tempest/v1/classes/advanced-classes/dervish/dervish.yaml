  The Dead Winds are a force of blistering sands and dry, remorseless, storm-scoured deserts. Some believe it to be an entity in of itself, while others see its handiwork and ascribe the abilities of Dervishes simply to the long, arduous hours spent in the training grounds. Whichever belief a warrior might hold, the "blessing of the Dead Wind" remains apparent.

  While Dervish is a blanket term used by most cultures to describe warriors who have similarly been blessed by the Dead Wind, each Dervish may receive their inspiration from the Dead Wind in their own unique way. The Dead Winds are a force of nature: not beholden to ideals such as right or wrong, and so, the wielders of the blessing share no morality or goal, simply method and a conviction that see them through.

  The Dervish eschews many of the basic trappings of the fighter, preferring light armor and paired blades as opposed to thick cumbersome shields and reticulated plate. They fight with unmatched speed and ferocity, augmented by the blistering sands of civilizations long lost and the restless spirits that wail on the wind.

  While few fables surround the Dervish as a whole, one popular tale is that of the Khet Longclaw "Djaro." In ages past, Djaro served his deity faithfully for thirty long years: his copper scimitar "Zhao," a whirling force to be reckoned with, they together slew mortal and beast alike with grace and deftness.

  In the tale, Djaro himself recounts how the Khet was outnumbered by intruders in his home. He stood his ground against the invaders, and when he lifted his blades in defense of his home, the wind carried them aloft accentuating his strikes with flowing, dance-like movements. Swirling with the breezes within his home, Djaro's opponents drew no blood from the Khet as they died, one by one, the blade they wielded no match for the copper laden gusts of death that whirled about the room.

  In the dawning light of the morning sun, Djaro recalled that as he laid down his blades, they made not the familiar clatter of copper on stone as he expected, but remained soft and light as a feather, with only the barest of sounds until they came to a rest, once again resuming their metallic ring then he drew them once more.
