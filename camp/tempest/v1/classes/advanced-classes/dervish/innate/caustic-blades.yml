description: |
  By concentrating on the shifting sands and the alchemical nature of the stone they walk upon, the Dervish may invest their weapons with the caustic nature of the elemental stone.

  The Dervish may add the Acid Accent to any unaccented Power, as well as any unaccented melee attack or thrown attack made with their weapons.
