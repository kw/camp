description: |
  When this Power is invoked, the Dervish alters the threads of time and fate, preparing themselves for the tribulations ahead.

  The Dervish enters a state of altered time by calling “Short Slow by Time.” The Dervish must then complete a Focus Slow 60. When completed, the Dervish gains the effects of a Short Rest.

  In addition, if the Dervish falls to Dying or is Deathblowed while under the effects of this Power, they may choose to end this Power to “Heal 3 by Time.“
