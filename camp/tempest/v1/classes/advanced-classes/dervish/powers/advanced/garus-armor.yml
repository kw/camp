description: |
  The Dervish peers through the sands of time, seeing the blows their foes will use against them. Until the Dervish completes a Short Rest, they have resistance to Damage below 3.

  The Dervish may end this Power early to grant themselves 6 points of Barrier by Time, or to Counter a Death Effect.
