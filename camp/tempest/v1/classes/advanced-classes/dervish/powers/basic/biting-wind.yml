description: |
  Dervish aren’t the armored frontline fighters you’d expect in a theater of war, but they still know how to misdirect and take pressure off their support.

  The Dervish may make a number of Thrown Weapon attacks equal to their Dervish class-level with the Call “Taunt 2.”

  Whenever you use a defense with the call “Counter, Dodge,” this power Refreshes.
