description: |
  Once per Short Rest, when you see an enemy use a Called defense to negate or reduce a Death effect, you may charge one of your weapons with a single attack of “Piercing 10” that can be used against that enemy anytime before your next Short Rest.

  In addition, this Power refreshes when the Dervish successfully completes a deathblow against the creature that initially triggered this power.
