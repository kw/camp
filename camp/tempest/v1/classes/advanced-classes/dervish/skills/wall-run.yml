description: |
  The Dervish may negate an environmental fall effect as long as they are moving and are touching a wall (If Lantern Spirits instruct you not to touch a “wall” for whatever reason you may extend your arm and pretend to touch it instead). If the Dervish removes their hand from the wall, or slows to a stop, the ability immediately ends and they take the environmental effect applicable to where they are currently standing.

  This ability may not be used while the Dervish is Hobbled.
