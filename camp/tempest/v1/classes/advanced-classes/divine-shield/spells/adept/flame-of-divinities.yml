description: |
  The Divine Shield can make five empowered attacks with a melee weapon. These attacks cannot be made at the Divine Shield themself. At the time of each attack, the Divine Shield can choose to do “Wounding 3 by Flame” or “Heal 3 by Flame” with the swing. This spell ends when all five attacks are used, or the Divine Shield completes a Short Rest. Expending a Spike with any one attack will increase the amount of Wounding or Healing to five for that attack.
