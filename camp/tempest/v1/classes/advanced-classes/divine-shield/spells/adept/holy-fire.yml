  Reaching to the sky, the Divine Shield calls down a bolt of holy fire, calling “[Name or Description] 4 Flame.” If the Power is Prevented, the Divine Shield may use a second Verbal attack with the Call “[Name or Description] 4 Radiance” against the same target. The Divine Shield adds two points to their Divine Pool.

  In addition, if the Divine Shield has a Basic Devotion power, they may use their Devotion’s Accent instead for both parts.
