description: |
  The Divine Shield allows their allies to use a specific Accent at great personal cost.

  The Divine Shield can grant any of the following Accents: Flame, Ice, Acid, Lightning, Radiance, or Darkness. In addition, if the Divine Shield has an Advanced Devotion power, they may Grant their Devotion’s Accent instead.

  The number of targets that may be chosen is equal to twice the Divine Shield’s class-level.

  When this spell is cast, the caster takes a Quick Drain and, unless all recipients are Chosen, also Sacrifices 4 Life Points.
