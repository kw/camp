description: |
  The Divine Shield can cause a body to take Spirit Form and come to them, usually for healing or life-saving spells.

  The Divine Shield first causes the character to become a Spirit and approach them, and then, once the target is within melee range, must give the second Instruction: to re-corporate and begin any death-timers from the beginning. The second Call should be made even if the caster is incapacitated or dead when the Spirit arrives or moves from the spot they were when they cast the Spell.
