description:
  The practice of a freezing cold bath to rinse away what ails a person is taken to an extreme by the elementalist, blasting away troubles at the expense of leaving the cured individual a shivering, drained mess. If the target accepts the cure, they also accept the drain - the drain could also be targeted and cured by this Spell, but would result in the target being further drained (and likely grumpy at the repeated ice bath).
