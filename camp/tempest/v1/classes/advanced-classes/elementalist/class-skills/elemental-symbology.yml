  The Elementalist finds power through the elements themselves, and not just the sources common to Sourcerers. If the Elementalist has a significant source of an appropriate element available - a torch for flame, a waterskin for ice, and so on - they may substitute that for the appropriate Eldritch source.

  Note: this does require an actual object that could be held in hand - the air surrounding the Elementalist does not suffice for a Lightning Source, for example.
