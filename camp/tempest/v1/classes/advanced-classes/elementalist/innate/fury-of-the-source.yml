description:
  A practiced Elementalist can take magic that has already been cast upon their person, and bend it to their ends. By voluntarily ending a beneficial Grant or Imbue effect already affecting the caster, the Elementalist can charge an additional Spell-Ball of a Spell that uses one of the fundamental element accents. This immediately empties the Elementalistâ€™s Wellspring pool, and may only be used if the Wellspring Pool has 5 or more points.
