description: |
  An Elementalist who studies the forces of Ice and Acid learns that these elements are perhaps the most enduring elements - and that endurance can be wielded to drive bitter shards into any who have been impacted by their power.

  Whenever the Elementalist casts a Spell that uses either the Acid or Ice Accent, the Elementalist may plant their right foot; Focus for a Quick 30 and Call “[Name or Description] 1 [Ice / Acid]” against the target they just hit. This damage cannot be modified in any way.

  They may continue to Focus and call these Verbal attacks against that target until the Elementalist casts another Spell, becomes Helpless, moves their right foot, or completes a Short Rest.
