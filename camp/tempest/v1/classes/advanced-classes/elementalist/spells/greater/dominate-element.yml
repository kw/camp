description: |
  The Elementalist’s command of the elements can allow them to find a creature imbued with sufficient amounts of that element, and then crush their will to their own ends.

  When the Elementalist casts this Spell, they pick a target and use the call: “[Name or Description] Discern by Will: Do you have Immunity or Selective Immunity to [Acid/Flame/Ice/Lightning]?” If the target answers in the affirmative, the Elementalist may then target that foe with “[Name or Description], Short Dominate by Will.”

  Note: If the target does not have immunity or selective immunity, the Spell is expended but may be refreshed by completing a Short Rest.
