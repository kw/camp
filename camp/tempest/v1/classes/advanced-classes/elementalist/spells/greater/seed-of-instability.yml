description: |
  The Elementalist is infused with a dubious blessing: an unstable mote of elemental flame is imbued into their form, which their consciousness can safely hold in check. Upon falling unconscious from damage or being killed by a death effect, the mote is unleashed to wreak havoc upon the surroundings.

  The Elementalist selects the three nearest targets to the best of their estimation, without regard to alliance, and targets them each with “[Name or Description] Piercing 7 by Flame”, one after another.
