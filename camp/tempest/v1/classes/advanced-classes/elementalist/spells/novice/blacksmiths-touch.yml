description: |
  When this Spell is cast, the Elementalist creates a charge to either Harm or Mend.

  If Harm is selected, a Shatter effect is created. The Elementalist may Shatter an item they are holding, reducing it to slag. In some circumstances with a marshal present, the Shatter Effect may be used on other unattended objects that the Elementalist can interact with, such as walls, doors, or other appropriate obstacles.

  If Mend is selected, it creates a powerful mending effect, with the unfortunate side effect of heating the armor enough to harm the individual wearing it (if worn).

  If the Elementalist has selected Flame as the element affected by Elemental Flow or is using a Flame Source, the Spell always produces one additional charge.

  Enhancement: Adept Spell-Slot: Two charges are created.
  Enhancement: Greater Spell-Slot: Four charges are created.
