description: |
  The Exemplar can speak in a way that leaves no room for doubt as to their convictions. They can use the Power Phrase “It can be believed…” to name a god they worship or to name their membership in a specific religion. “It can be believed that I worship Sodron” or “It can be believed that I am a Follower of the Tower” are both valid examples. This can be done at-will.
