description: |
  This spell allows an Exemplar to temporarily restrain a divine entity. This spell charges a number of Spell-Balls or weapon strikes with “Short Root to [Demon / Angel] by [Radiance / Darkness]” equal to the Exemplar’s class-level.

  Alternatively, a point of Divine Grace may be expended when the Spell-Ball or weapon is charged to charge it with “Short Bind to [Demon / Angel] by [Radiance / Darkness].” The Exemplar may continue
  to charge weapons and spell-balls and use this call at-will as long as the Exemplar plants their right foot and does not move it, or becomes Helpless.
