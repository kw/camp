description: |
  It is not enough for the Exemplar to take a stance against evil, they must actively seek to destroy it. This Spell imbues a single strike with a melee weapon with a compelling challenge, to force
  the most vile of beasts to face them in single combat. The Call for this Power is “Taunt 20 to [Dark, Undead, or Undevoted.]” If the Taunt is Prevented by an enemy the Exemplar refreshes up to 2
  expended Divine Graces.

  The character may expend a Divine Grace to refresh a use of the “Parry Blow” Power (including Parry Blow II, III, etc.).
