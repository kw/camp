description: |
  The caster grants themself 6 points of Summoned Armor. This is considered a new “suit” of armor and is not stackable with other sources of summoned armor. The Exemplar may choose to give themself a +5 bonus to their Maximum Physical Armor instead, if desired. This spell also grants a single Protection from Voice or Verbal to the Exemplar. The recipient should call out “Protect” to Counter a Voice or Verbal attack. Both the Summoned Armor and the bonus to Physical Armor last until the Exemplar completes a Long Rest.

  Additionally, as long as the Exemplar has at least 6 points of armor (summoned, physical, or natural and remember Barrier is also a type of Armor) the Exemplar may spend a Focus Quick 100 to Mend 3 to an attuned shield.

  If cast as a Master level spell, this grants the Exemplar 8 Summoned Armor Points instead, or +6 Maximum Armor to physically worn armor. (Reminder: The Rule of 3 does not apply to effects from a single Source.)
