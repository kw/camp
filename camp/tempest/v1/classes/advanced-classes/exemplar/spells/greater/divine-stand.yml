  Once this spell is cast, the Exemplar is granted the following suite of powers:

    * Heal to Full, Mend to Full, and Rebuild on the Exemplar’s Shield, Armor, and Weapon
    * Unaccented Weapon Damage Resistance
    * Resistance to Radiance, Darkness, and the Exemplar’s Chosen Accent
    * +1 Base Damage
    * +3 Base Spike Damage
    * +3 Base Maximum Spikes

  In addition, the Exemplar may expend any number of Divine Graces to add one (per Divine Grace expended) of any of the following abilities to their weapon:

    * The wielder becomes immune to Disarm, Shatter and Disable Effects. The wielder should call "No Effect" when these Effects occur.
    * If the weapon is a great weapon, it can be wielded in one hand without penalty or restriction.
    * The weapon is wielded as if the Exemplar was proficient with that weapon.
    * The weapon gains resistance to Materia.
    * By expending a Divine Grace, the character can Counter one Materia or Verbal that targets them by Calling "Counter: Divine Avenger”
    * The weapon can add a +2 damage bonus by adding "to Demon" as a Qualifier to any damaging attack. This will increase Wounding and Piercing Effects as well.
    * The weapon can add a +2 damage bonus by adding "to Angel" as a Qualifier to any damaging attack. This will increase Wounding and Piercing Effects as well.
    * By expending a Divine Grace, the weapon can be charged with three “Heal 3 by Radiance” blows which will have the Weapon delivery. These will go away when the Spell ends.
    * The first time the Exemplar drops to 0 Life Points, they are healed to full Life Points. If the character is affected by Death, the Exemplar may call "Counter: Divine Avenger" once.
    * The weapon can do Death to Helpless at-will and will Heal the wielder for 2 Life Points each time.

  Once the Exemplar leaves combat, becomes Helpless, or completes a Short Rest, they immediately assume Spirit Form, and must proceed to the appropriate location (usually the Spirit Well).
