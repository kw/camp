description: |
  When casting this spell, the Exemplar charges their weapons with “Wounding 3 by Radiance.” For all levels of the spell if the Exemplar is wielding two weapons, each weapon is charged. If the character is using a Great Weapon, this spell can instead be used to call “Wounding 5 by Radiance.”

  If cast with an Adept Spell-Slot it becomes “Wounding 6 by Radiance” or “Wounding 8 by Radiance” with a Great Weapon.

  If cast with a Greater Spell-Slot it becomes “Wounding 10 by Radiance” or “Wounding 12 by Radiance” with a Great Weapon.

  For all levels of the spell, by expending a Divine Grace, each weapon gains an additional charge.

  Enhancement: You may expend a Spike to add your Spike Damage to this spell.
