description: |
  Years in the streets with little but their bare fists have taught the Hooligan that while a weapon is often preferable, the fist is reliable, always available, and difficult to ignore when applied properly.

  The Hooligan gains the ability to wield Natural Weapons with the following restrictions:

    * These Natural Weapons may be only Hand Weapons.
    * These Natural Weapons may not be used to deliver Effects, and can do a maximum of 1 damage.

  However, they also gain these benefits:

    * The Hooligan may wield two of these if they have Two Weapon Style.
    * These Natural weapons are immune to Disarm.

  Should the Hooligan have or gain Natural Weapons from another source, the restrictions are lifted, but the benefits remain.
