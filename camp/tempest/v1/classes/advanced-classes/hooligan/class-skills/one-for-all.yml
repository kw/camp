description: |
  If all members of the Crew present in any given ‘encounter’ (combat, delve into a cave, particularly hostile negotiation, etc) are Helpless, Dying, Dead, or Spirits, the Hooligan may then call out a Team Motto, Chant, or other posse-significant saying, and then Call “[Names or Descriptions] [Stabilize, Grant Life or/and Cure All Conditions.]” The call may be for either the crew as a whole, or a compound call for the individual character’s names.  The Hooligan then immediately becomes a Spirit and must proceed to the Spirit Well.
