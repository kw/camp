description: |
  While the Hooligan can see one of their Crew is down and possibly Dying, they may expend a Spike to “Counter, Elude” a Weapon Delivery or Materia Delivery Power or attack that strikes the Hooligan.

  If the Hooligan is Dying, and one of the Crew is in Touch range, the Dying Hooligan may pause their death count until their Crewmember is no longer in Touch range; this is a Passive, at-will ability.
