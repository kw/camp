description: |
  Hooligans are inspired by their friends and fellows, and as such have a tendency to turn into quite the force when their band of compatriots shows their allegiance in force.

  The Hooligan may lead a chant or cheer unique to their Crew, in a huddle. If the group chants along and each individual has a clear indication that they belong together (such as a belt flag, tabard or symbol), the Crew member may add +2 Bonus Spike Damage to their Spikes for a Short Rest. After finishing the cheer, the Hooligan may call “Short Grant +2 Bonus Spike Damage” to each Crew member that participated.
