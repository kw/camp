description: |
  Sometimes the only way out, or in, is through… physically. The Hooligan may activate this Power to:

    * Out-of-combat, expend a Spike to call “Shatter [Item] by Force” by weapon at-will.
    * Expend a Spike to do “Shatter Armor to Constructs” against a creature the Hooligan believed to be an Automaton or Construct.

  Both of these options end when the Hooligan takes a Short Rest.

  In addition, when the Hooligan attempts to gain entry to a building protected by a Haven Ritual,  the Hooligan may mark off four Haven Charges even when this Power is not active. Thus, when rebuffed by a Haven, the Hooligan may remove four tokens instead of the normal one.
