description: |
  The hooligan knows that sometimes the Crew just isn’t up to a particular task, and that it needs to be handled by the Hooligan themself.  If this power is not prevented, the Hooligan’s spikes are immediately fully refreshed.

  Functionally, this is a one on one duel, so while the target of the Taunt is engaged by no one else the Hooligan gains the following benefits:

    * The Hooligan gains Plus Spike Damage equal to the number of their Crew present.
    * The Hooligan gains resistance to Unaccented Damage and Effects.

  Note: The Plus Spike Damage bonus may, by itself, exceed the Stacking norm of +3 since it’s from a single source.

  If the Hooligan is victorious (i.e. kills, downs, or renders Helpless the foe), they are immediately Healed to Full and Cured of any Conditions they wish.

  If the duel stops for any reason, all ongoing benefits are lost and the power ends.
