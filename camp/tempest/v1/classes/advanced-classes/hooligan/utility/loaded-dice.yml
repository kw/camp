  When the Hooligan rolls a die or dice, they may immediately reroll any number of those dice and call “It Can Be Believed: This die/dice roll is [X], and was untampered with,” where X is the result of the second roll.

  Note: Winning at gambling is a great way to earn wealth, but most Houses aren’t a huge fan of getting fleeced. Seeing one individual return to the table over and over and wipe them clean is a great way to earn a one way ticket to a dark alley with other Hooligans.
