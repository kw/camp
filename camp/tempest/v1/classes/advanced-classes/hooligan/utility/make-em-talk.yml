description: |
  After making a Spike Attack with the Agony Accent to a creature, the Hooligan may Focus Quick 100 to refresh that Spike.

  In addition, after doing damage with the Agony accent to a Helpless but otherwise conscious foe, the Hooligan may call an Obey effect against that target with the following questions:

    * What is your name?
    * Why are you here?
    * Who is your boss?
    * Where’s your hideout?
    * Where’d you stash the loot?

  Note: Variations on these questions are allowed for roleplaying purposes, but significant deviations that alter the intent of the questions are prohibited. Also, this power does not compel truth, so answers to these questions may be of dubious value.
