name: Divine Supplication
requires: inquisitor:1
description: |
  The path of an Inquisitor is not for the weak willed or decision adverse. While most people give homage to their religion of choice, the Inquisitor must supplicate to a specific deity above all others.  If the Inquisitor follows a religion that venerates multiple gods such as the Ember Light, Guardians, Manifold Path, or Ringwitches and also does not have a Patron that is a Deity they may not use this Power.  As the Inquisitor devotes themselves to a deity, their connection with their deity deepens and the words of the Inquisitor gain the weight of their deity. The deity the Inquisitor supplicates to does not necessarily need to be venerated in the Religion they worship.

  For example: If Fira is a follower of the Emberlight, they could supplicate to Yaziri specifically as the deity who grants them their powers as an Inquisitor. Thurgo is a Ring Witch, therefore they could not become an Inquisitor of the Worldsoul without abandoning their Religion because one of the tenets of their Religion is to venerate both Worldsoul and the Pharaoh equally. Marne, a follower of the Well, could become an Inquisitor of Kemis so long as Kemis and Olfrin’s tenets don’t clash.
