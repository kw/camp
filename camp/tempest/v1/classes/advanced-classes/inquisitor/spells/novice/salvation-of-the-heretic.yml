  A special privilege is reserved for those who actively speak in contradiction to that which is good. That which is good is all that god says is; the Tenets of the Inquisitor’s Religion. For those who speak such blasphemy, they are heretics. The Inquisitor may invoke the wrath of their god to charge a spell-ball to call “Wounding 2 by Radiance.”

  If the first Spell-Packet hits and the attack is not prevented, the Inquisitor may call “[Name or Description] 4 Radiance to [Abomination, Undead, or Undevoted]” to the target the Spell-Packet struck.
