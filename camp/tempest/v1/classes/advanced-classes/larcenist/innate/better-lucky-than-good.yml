  Having lived to tell the tale many times over, the Larcenist know when to press their luck, and when to fold - however, there are just times when, even through harrowing adversity it’s better to press on, and the Larcenist’s knack for survival shines brightest when the chips are down.

  Once per Event, the Larcenist may instantly refresh their Luck charges to full.  Additionally, The Knack may now spend 2 points of Luck to Counter Melee or Ranged Weapon attack or 4 points of Luck to Counter a Verbal or Voice attack.
