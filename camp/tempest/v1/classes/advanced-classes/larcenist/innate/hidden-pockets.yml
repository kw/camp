description: |
  The Larcenist may designate one pouch (no more than 8” in any one dimension) as their Hidden Pocket. The Hidden Pocket can only contain Wealth, Hide, Harvest, Ore, Rare Minerals, Bloom, and Night Prizes. Once marked with a Halo Sigil, the contents of the pouch are immune to searches and Powers and are excluded when answering Discern questions. The power does not need to be announced, and can be ignored by the Larcenist.

  Note: Should the Larcenist have a similar ability from elsewhere, such as the Socialite’s Smuggler’s Powdercase, this ability stacks with that one, allowing an additional pouch to be protected.
