description: |
  The Larcenist knows that words spoken without care are the shortest path to a gibbetâ€™s rope, and so has carefully practiced the art of deflecting hard questions and probing interrogations. When the Larcenist is the lone target of a Discern by Mind, they may expend a Luck Charge to Obfuscate themselves in response.

  Note: The Luck Charge can be expended after the Discern Call is made to preemptively gain Obfuscate for that Call.
