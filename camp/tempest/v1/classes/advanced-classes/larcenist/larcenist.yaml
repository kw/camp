description: |
  The Larcenist operates by one motto alone: “What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is mine.” Whether simple coin, valuable art, or more esoteric objects, what the Larcenist wants, little can stop them from acquiring.

  Perhaps the best Larcenists are those who are little-known, notoriety comes often to the careless and unsuccessful, and so finding oneself a reputation can be a double edged sword.

  However one finds themselves in the trade that only goes one way, the Larcenist is among the most well-equipped to deal with the slings and arrows of fate and watchful guards, slipping into vaults and safes without a sound, and exiting with wealth untold.
