description: |
  The Larcenist need not always perform their trade under cover of night. Sometimes, “hiding in plain sight” is the best method for intrusion: simply acting as though one belongs, and going about their business is enough to keep the watchful eyes of guards from landing upon them.

  Out of combat, the Larcenist may call out against a foe the Verbal component, and simply go about their business.

  If the Larcenist expends two Luck Charges, this power may be immediately refreshed.
