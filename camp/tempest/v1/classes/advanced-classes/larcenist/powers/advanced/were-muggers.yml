  Sometimes the most direct method is best: strongarming someone through raw intimidation doesn’t always work, but off-the-cuff threats of violence work more often than some might expect.

  This ability may only be used out-of-combat and when the Larcenist and their allies outnumber the target and their allies in the area. The Larcenist may target up to three individuals to call “[Name or Description] Short Obey to Living by Fear: Hand me all your coin.”
