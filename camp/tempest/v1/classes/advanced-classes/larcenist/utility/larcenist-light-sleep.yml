description: |
  While the Larcenist is a master of taking what isn’t theirs, they also are subject to the same theft as everyone else, or worse: stalkers in the night invading their sanctums. Some Larcenists have honed their perceptions to the point that those who would intrude, even while the Larcenist is asleep, can be detected, and prepared for.

  The Larcenist should declare a Sanctum where they will sleep - During the nighttime (7pm to 7am), any intruder into the Sanctum must stop and go out of play to check the location for the Larcenist, wake them if necessary, and then return to the location where they will attempt entry in-play.

  The Larcenist is required to designate their Sanctum: This should be prominently marked on the outside of all entrances with a 6” square sign, with a white background and a Blue Exclamation Mark. On the reverse of the sign, the words “Light Sleep” should be prominently visible along with the Larcenists’ Character Name, Player Name, and Sleeping Location. It is the player’s responsibility to ensure these signs are posted at all entrances to the Sanctum, and that they are easily visible and able to be read easily at night.
