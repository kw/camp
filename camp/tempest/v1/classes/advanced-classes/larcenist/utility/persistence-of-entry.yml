description: |
  The Larcenist is all too familiar with Havens and the problems they create when attempting a little wealth redistribution. Through persistence, the right tools, and a quiet location with which to do their work, even the most fortified of locations will eventually fall to the Larcenist’s “request” for entry.

  When attempting entry into an area protected by a Haven, the Larcenist may roleplay breaking in for a Focus Quick 100. When they complete their count, they may remove a number of Haven charges equal to their Larcenist class-level.

  Note: The Larcenist is not considered to have triggered the Haven’s prohibitions for attempting entry, and may use this ability at-will and consecutively against the same Haven.
