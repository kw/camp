description:
  The Mentalist can only cast this Cantrip if hidden in some way, even if this is a token effort. Standing behind a pillar, covering one’s self with a tablecloth, and crouching in a dark corner all count for the purposes of this Cantrip. Once hidden, the Incantation is spoken and the character becomes Insubstantial until they communicate (in-game) to another, until they leave the hiding spot, or they complete a Short Rest, at which point they must call "Dispel Insubstantial!"
