description: |
  The Mentalist may Discern "Yes/No" questions of the target. The structure of these calls is:

  "Subtle Discern by Mind: Yes or No: [Question]"

  Each time the Mentalist asks a question, they must either Sacrifice one Life Point or Link. The Power ends when the Mentalist is Healed, leaves Touch range, or the Target is no longer Helpless. A "No" answer ends this power unless the Mentalist Sacrifices a Link.

  No more questions can be asked with this power than the  class-levels of the Mentalist.

  Note: Unlike most Psychic Surgery, Mindsift is not generally consensual. Because it is a Touch Delivered Power, this generally means that the target must be Helpless or Incapacitated.
