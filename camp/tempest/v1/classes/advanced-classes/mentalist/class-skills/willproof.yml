description: |
  The Mentalist helps the patient set up blocks in their mind to stop the influence of others. This takes the form of two Grant effects.

    * The patient is Granted a single Protect vs Charm and Dominate.
    * A trigger is created in the patientâ€™s mind. If the patient is successfully Charmed or Dominated, they may immediately either call a Verbal "[Name or Description] Silence by Mind" on the source of that Charm or Dominate Effect OR can choose to take a "Sleep by Mind" on themselves.
