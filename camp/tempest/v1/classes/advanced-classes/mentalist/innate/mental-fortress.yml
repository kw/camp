description: |
  The Mentalist is a veritable fortress of mental might, and while repeated assault might eventually bring them low, doing so would be a supreme feat. The Mentalist may choose to have resistance to the Mind Accent: for any given Effect with the Mind Accent, the Mentalist may allow it to function or call "Resist" and take 1 point of damage. While unconscious, the character does not have access to this resistance.
