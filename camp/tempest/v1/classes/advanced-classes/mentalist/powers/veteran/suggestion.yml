  This Power has different functions in and out of combat..

  Out of combat, it requires the Mentalist and the target to be in conversation or other intimate communication for a period of at least a minute. The Mentalist can then use "[Name or Description] Subtle Short Obey by Mind:" followed by a single-clause command. The command has the following limitations: The target cannot be made to feel a particular emotion, obey additional commands, or do anything that would obviously cause them immediate harm. Additionally, no commands requiring physical contact or intimate behavior are possible.

  In combat, it requires the Mentalist to have successfully used a Power with the Mind Accent on the target (not Prevented or missed) since the last time they completed a Short Rest. The Mentalist can then use one of the following commands as a Verbal after the Call "[Name or Description] Subtle Short Obey by Mind:"

    * “Disarm yourself and remain disarmed.”
    * “Do not harm me in any way unless I harm you first.”
    * “Do not heal yourself.”
    * “Walk directly away from me for 30 paces.”
    * “Remove as many of your own defenses as you can.”
    * “Protect me from harm, unless my allies or I harm you.”

  This power may be refreshed by expending a Link and a Spike in addition to undergoing a Short Rest.
