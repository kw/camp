  The Mentalist can work on crafting and can set a slice of their mind to performing some menial task while they concentrate on other things. The Mentalist can, if necessary, use the Power Phrase "It can be seenâ€¦" to inform others that telekinetic crafting is occuring. This Power can manifest in one of two ways:

    * The Mentalist can perform some repetitive action for crafting mentally (stretching hides, hammering ingots into plates, grinding powder), while performing simple tasks such as holding conversation, playing cards, or resting. The appropriate time must still be spent.
    * The Mentalist can perform a secondary task while actively crafting. This can allow the Mentalist to "skip" one manual repetitive part of a Crafting Recipe such as repeated bellows pumps, repeated hammering, repeated grinding in a pestle, etc. If this is a timed task, the appropriate time must be spent, but no actual RP of actions need take place. Only one action can be skipped per recipe.
