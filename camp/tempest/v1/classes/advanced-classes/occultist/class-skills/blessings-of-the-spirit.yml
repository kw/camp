description:
  Your practiced prayers and genuine offerings to the spirits are of a higher quality than most, and they offer you more in return. While this does not increase the strength of your spiritual protection, it does extend its durability. The first 3 points you spend from your Protection of the Spirits each Long Rest do not reduce your Maximum Summoned Armor points.
