  Your knowledge of the occult and the mystic arts blend well together, allowing you to refresh powers with the [Mystic] tag. You may spend 1 point of your Protection of the Spirits to immediately refresh such a power if it has Short Rest refresh, or 4 points if it has Long Rest refresh.

  Additionally, you may target yourself when using the Living Iron artisan power or its modified form Life Flow, but only when wearing your Protection of the Spirits Summoned Armor.
