description: |
  Whenever you cast from a scroll, you need only recite the incantation once. If you can perform the incantation without looking, you do not need to actually read from the scroll â€” touching it with a hand is sufficient. You may therefore activate a scroll even if it is folded, rolled, or too dark to see, as long as you know its contents.

  Once per Short Rest, you may cast a single Adept-tier scroll or lower without expending it. An Occultist may use this power [Occultist level] times per Long Rest for each purchase of this power.
