requires: soothsayer
description: |
  Between events, you may ask the Plot team for up to three fortunes for characters (PC or NPC) of your choice, or alternatively, a longer list of characters from which three will be chosen by plot. The results will be delivered in sealed, black-keyed notes to you at game, though depending on circumstances you may receive notes for more or different characters than you requested. If Plot informs you that they were unable to produce your fortunes, for this event you gain 1 bonus spend of Protection of the Spirits per Long Rest for each fortune not delivered. These bonus points function the same as, and stack with, those provided Blessing of the Spirits skill.

  You know which characters have fortunes you can read at any given time, but you may not read these until you are about to perform a fortune telling ceremony with the character named on the envelope. This might take the form of reading tea leaves, peering into a crystal ball, reading the bones, or some similar roleplay. You may read the contents of a characterâ€™s fortune a short while ahead of such a ceremony for preparation purposes, but you have no in-game knowledge of the fortune until the ceremony has been performed.

  The fortunes themselves will generally be short and cryptic; they may be information valuable to the target, or they may be hints toward little-known information about the target that may be valuable to you or someone else. In either case, you are not under any compulsion to read the fortune verbatim, or even at all, to the target.

  Any unread fortunes should be returned to plot at the end of the event. Plot may opt to return these to you if the contents are still valid.
