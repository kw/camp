description: |
  Your initiation into the occult allows a basic manipulation of the energies surrounding an individual. You may expend either a Rare Minerals or a Harvest to gain a standard effect, or Sacrifice 1 Life Point of blood (not necessarily your blood) to get a stronger effect. Sacrificing blood in this manner is considered Blood Magic; the other sacrifices are not. The appropriate incantations and calls are:

    * Rare Minerals: “With sacred salts I abjure the Dark”, “Short Grant Minus One Dark Territory”
    * Harvest: “By tooth and claw I invoke the Dark”, “Short Grant Plus One Dark Territory”
    * Blood: “By lifeblood spilled I welcome the Dark”, “Short Grant Plus Two Dark Territory”

  Note: Recall that a given target may only have this effect applied to them once at any given time, per Stacking.
