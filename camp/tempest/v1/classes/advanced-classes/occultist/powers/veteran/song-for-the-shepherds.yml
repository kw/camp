description:
  While conversing with Spirits is a common practice for Occultists, some are willing to risk conversing with greater powers of the cycle. With this power, the Occultist may convey a message into the well, though they might not always know who receives it. To use this power, the Occultist must target a Spirit that already has the Strong Spirit Supernatural Perk, either through their own choices or Granted by the Occultist with the Empower the Departed Advanced Power. The Occultist may Sacrifice a point of Protection of the Spirits to give the Spirit a message to be delivered to whomever or whatever they encounter in the Spirit Well. This can be a question, statement, or whatever the Occultist wishes – the only stipulation is that it must be approximately 140 characters or less. If the Occultist has time, they are expressly allowed to write this message down and give it to the spirit, ignoring normal rules for Spirit interacting with the physical realm. The Occultist may seal this message and instruct the Spirit not to read this message. This message does not guarantee any response from the entity that receives the message and offers no protection for the Spirit from the reaction of the entity that receives the message.
