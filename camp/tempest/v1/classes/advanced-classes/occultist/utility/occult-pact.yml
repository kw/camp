name: Occult Pact
description: |
  While much of occult study focuses on lesser known forces and spirits, many occultists specialize in the study of greater, more secretive entities. In the search for knowledge, you have made a pact with one such being, and they provide you with insights about the signs and ways of their rivals.

  You gain the Patron perk, as well as the Gift of Recognition perk. When you use Gift of Recognition, you may use the name of any Patron in the Discern Call, not just your own. Be aware that this Discern is not Subtle, and making a Patronâ€™s recognition signs to the wrong people may have unwanted consequences.
