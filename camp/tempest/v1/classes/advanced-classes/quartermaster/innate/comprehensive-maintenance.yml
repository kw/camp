requires: quartermaster:1
description: |
  Keeping equipment in good shape is an important part of any Quartermaster’s duties, even if they aren’t able to create that equipment to begin with. Whether they have the necessary craft skill or not, a Quartermaster may spend 4 Hourglass Turns (which might be modified by other powers) performing maintenance roleplay on an object, person, or place created or modified with any Crafting skill, so long as the original recipe, plan, formula, or ritual is available to work with, and the craft in question has not yet expired.

  If a crafting workstation is required to create the craft, the Quartermaster must be at an appropriate location. By expending all of the materials and other sacrifices normally required to create the craft, you may reset the craft’s Expiration date as though it had been newly crafted by you. This does not count as an act of creation in and of itself, so no new Dark Territory draws are required.
