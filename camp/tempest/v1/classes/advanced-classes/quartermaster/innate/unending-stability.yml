  A single category of single-use items you craft that are listed as having Standard expiration instead have a Permanent duration. The Quartermaster must choose from a list of options:

    * Alchemy with an Application of Quaff
    * Alchemy with an Application of Topical
    * Scrolls
    * Repair Kits and Sharpening Stones (Including Enchanted Repair Kits or Sharpening Stones)

  This only functions with crafting that produces a new item â€” crafts that modify an existing object, creature, or place (such as most Enchantments and Rituals) do not qualify, even if they are consumed after a single use.
