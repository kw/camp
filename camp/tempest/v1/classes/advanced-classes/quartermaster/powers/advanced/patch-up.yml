description:
  The Quartermaster can perform feats of repair beyond what normal folk could hope to achieve… for a few minutes anyway. The quartermaster sets to work doing whatever repairs can be attempted to a piece of personal equipment, door, or other object smaller than a door. After a Focus Quick 100, call “Rebuild [Item]”. If the repaired item is a Shield, Armor, Door, or other object that can be mended, then call “Mend to Full” on it. The Quartermaster may Rebuild and Mend a number of items equal to their Quartermaster class-level per Long Rest.
