description: |
  A Forgesource contains the power of creation, and with a little knowhow, it can contain other things. Once per Short Rest, when you would trigger a Hazard while prospecting or a Pollution Call while crafting, you may sacrifice a Forgesource to call “Contain Disaster.” This prevents the hazard from triggering, protecting those around you.

  At some point before the end of the event, you may unleash that disaster. Using either a Spell Ball or a thrown weapon representation of a Forgesource, you may throw the effect that would have been triggered. If the contained hazard originally used Voice delivery, (for example, “By My Voice Piercing 5 by Poison”), you may alternatively trigger that effect, but you take the effect yourself as Final.
