description: |
  Time is valuable, and you don’t always have a lot. You know how to cut the red tape.

    * When you Prospect, Forage, Scavenge, or Loot, you may call “Expedite Procurement” and skip the count. If you trigger a hazard or the creature being scavenged and/or looted produces a Verbal-delivered attack, you may counter it with “Counter, I don’t have time for this.”
    * When you would draw a Foundation Resource from the Planar Weir during a Tap Primordial Rift formula or other means of accessing the Weir, you may instead call “Expedite Procurement, Draw X”, where X is a Foundation Resource of your choice. You are treated as having drawn that resource normally. If some reason exists that a particular resource is not available at the Weir, you may not draw it this way.
