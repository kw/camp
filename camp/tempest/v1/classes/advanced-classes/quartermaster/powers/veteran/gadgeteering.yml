  While maintaining and in some cases constructing weapons is generally within a Quartermaster’s purview, some take things further with experimental modifications. By spending 2 Hourglass turns modifying a piece of manufactured equipment at a Tinker’s Forge, you can add certain benefits that the recipient can use. These benefits last until the end of the event unless otherwise specified. A single piece of equipment may not have multiple modifications.

    * **Blast Shield** (X Forgesources): Sacrifice a number of Forgesources, up to the maximum Shield Points of a particular shield to install explosive defenses. You may call “Counter, Blast Shield” in response to any damaging attack that strikes the shield, but the shield takes 1 Shield-Breaking in the process. The shield has a number of uses of this ability equal to the number of Forgesources installed, but can’t be used in this way while Shattered. You may perform this modification again later to replenish spent charges, but the total number of charges can’t exceed the shield’s maximum Shield Points.
    * **Long Mender** (1 Forgesource, 2 Rare Mineral): You carve a series of channels into a staff or polearm and install a Forgesource to manage the flow of liquids or certain energies through them. The wielder may deliver the effects of an artisan’s Living Iron power as well as potions or spells that deliver Heal or Cure calls by touching the target with the weapon (a true swing is not necessary). More complex potions, poisons, and spells are too viscous to flow through this device.
    * **Rescue Hook** (1 Forgesource, 3 Ingot): This contraption may be installed on any Great Weapon, or on a one-handed weapon that has a head (axes, hammers, and the like, but not basic straight weapons). This weapon may be used to pull a character who might not otherwise be conveniently reachable, and without needing to drop one’s weapon. To use it, touch a helpless or willing character with the head of your weapon, then call: “[Name or description]: Carrying you with my weapon”. You must use the weapon in two hands unless you could normally carry a creature with only one hand.
    * **Poison Caches** (1-3 Harvest): You may add 1-3 breakable containers (one per Harvest expended) to a weapon which a Poisoner or Alchemist can fill with a topical substance over the usual Quick 30. The wielder of the weapon may call one of the stored alchemical effects on any swing, consuming the substance and the container, which can’t be refilled. The weapon may additionally have a substance applied to its surface in the normal way; if one of the containers is activated before the applied substance is used, the applied substance is lost. Replacement Poison Caches may be created later, but a single weapon may have no more than three.
    * **Bolas** (3 Ingot): You modify a thrown weapon to include a wire and counterweight. When the user throws it, they may call either “Quick Bind by Force” or “Quick Root by Force” on hit. Once the effect is called, this modification is expended. You may make up to 4 Bolas in a single use of this power, but each costs 3 Ingots.
    * **Special Ammo** (Foundation Resource: Energy): You modify a bow, crossbow, or other projectile weapon such that ammunition fired from it may be elementally charged. Select Acid, Lightning, Ice, or Flame. The wielder may change the accent of any damaging attack launched from this weapon to the chosen accent up to 10 times.
    * **Vibration Blade** (Foundation Resource [Ruin or Power]): You give a bladed Hand weapon such as a dagger the capacity to destroy a suit of armor, once. The user must strike the target’s torso (not their limbs, weapons, or shield), so an attack from behind is ideal, though not required. If the torso is successfully struck, the attacker may call “Shatter Armor by Force”. Only a single use of this ability may be placed in a weapon.
    * **Trap Improvement** (Forgesource, optional Foundation Resource [Energy and/or Power]): You improve the efficiency of a trap. If the trap deals damage, its damage number increases by +3. If you use a Power foundation resource in this modification, the damage becomes Piercing. If you use an Energy foundation resource, the trap’s Accent changes to your choice of Acid, Lightning, Ice, or Flame, even if it was an Alchemical Trap loaded with a poison effect. A trap modified in this manner keeps its modification until triggered or until the trap expires.
