description: |
  You intertwine a container’s protection with a Haven ritual or Ward spell. The container must be hard-walled (a box, not a bag) and must clearly open and close, but can otherwise be of any size that will fit into the haven. Closets are valid Vaults, but not rooms; if it is unclear if a space is a closet or a room, a closet has only one door and no windows. The vault may additionally be locked, trapped, glyphed, or otherwise protected.

  To make the vault, you must be inside of a Haven or Ward. Spend a Focus Quick 100 drawing invisible circuits on the faces of the intended container using a Forgesource, then sacrifice the Forgesource and say “By the power of my craft, I protect what is precious.” Attach a card with a Black Key to the container’s lid or door. On it, write: “Can only be moved, opened, or modified by those connected to this Haven/Ward as long as it has charges. Can not be Shattered or removed from this Haven/Ward as long as it has charges. Created by: [your name]. Note that you do not have to be connected to the Haven or Ward in question so long as you are inside of it.

  You may create as many Vaults connected to a particular Haven or Ward per event as you wish, but you can only  create a vault to which you are entitled to open (such as being able to enter a Haven/Ward). Each additional Vault in a particular Haven beyond the first reduces the maximum amount of “stones” the Haven can hold by five.
