cost: 2
requires: ranger:1
description: |
  The Ranger gains an animal companion, large enough to assist in the Ranger’s affairs. This companion is usually an Animal, Beast, Mythical Beast or Drake, but some exceptions exist. In either case, the Animal Companion in question must be approved by a member of Plot.

  The Ranger gains the benefits of the Menagerie construction building, but only for one creature that has become the Ranger’s Companion. If that creature dies, the Ranger may train a new Animal Companion with one month of work.

  If the Ranger wishes to utilize their Companion on stage, they must contact a member of Plot with a Plot approved PC and costume to portray the Animal Companion.
