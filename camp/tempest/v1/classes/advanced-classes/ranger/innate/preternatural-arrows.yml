description: |
  The Ranger is aware of the vulnerabilities of their prey, and prepares accordingly. Choose an accent from the following list: [Flame, Poison, Agony, Force]. Until the Ranger takes a Short Rest, they may alter the Accent (or add the accent, if the original attack was unaccented) of their projectile attacks to the chosen accent.
