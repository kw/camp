  The Ranger’s expertise with their Ranger’s Mark power is at another level.  In addition to the normal Ranger’s Mark Innate Power’s abilities, the Ranger may Aim and spend a Spike to add their Spike Damage to the attack twice with a projectile weapon.

  The Ranger must still follow all normal requirements for Ranger’s Mark and Aim. For example, if the Ranger’s Base Damage is 2 and Spike Damage is +1 (the base Spike Damage), they would call “4”.
