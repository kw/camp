  The Ranger may spend a Spike and make a ranged attack, calling out "Piercing 4 to [Animal / Foe Type]." If the attack strikes your Ranger’s Mark, you may refresh a Basic power with the Wounding or Piercing effect from the Fighter or Rogue Classes.

  If this attack is made from outside of combat, the Ranger need only aim for a Quick 10.
