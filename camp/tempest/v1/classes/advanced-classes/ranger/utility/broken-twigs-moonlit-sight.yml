description:
  There exists no better hunters across the realms than the Ranger, and every piece of evidence the Ranger can collect is paramount to a successful hunt. The Ranger gains the Tracking Skill, and becomes incredibly adept at finding their Quarry, should they be lost. They may call “[Name or Description] Expose.” The target of this power must have been your most recent Ranger’s Mark, though they need not still be your Ranger’s Mark.
