description: |
  The Ranger is a patient hunter, often lying in wait long enough that snow accumulates on their downy coats. When the Ranger finishes their Quick 10 Count for a Projectile Weapons Aim mechanic, they may continue to aim to hone their focus for that shot by continuing their count. Each additional Quick 10 that they aim gives them +1 Spike Damage for that shot, up to a maximum of +3 Spike Damage.

  Note: This bonus damage cannot exceed the Spike Damage stacking cap.
