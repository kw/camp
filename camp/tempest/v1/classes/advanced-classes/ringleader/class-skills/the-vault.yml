  After a few moments of working the Ringleader can trigger a container to become a Vault the next time it is closed. A Vault’s contents are generally unreachable unless certain Powers (Dispel Magic, Ritual Disjunction, etc) are used that will get past the safeguards.

  The Safebox needs to be created at a Tinkering Station with an Item Info Card containing the following:

    * Attach the item information card to the Safebox when complete
    * The Safebox’s maximum dimensions are 2’x2’x3’
    * The Safebox gains inherent Shatter immunity
    * The Ringleader’s Name must be listed on the card
    * “Generic Forged Item” may create ‘keys’ that add additional names to the Information Card
    * Add a black keyhole Sigil and write “Only opens for the Listed Names.”
