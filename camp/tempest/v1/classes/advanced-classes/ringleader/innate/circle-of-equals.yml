description: |
  The ringleader, in times of duress, can inspire their Enforcers to exceptional heights they were not previously capable of.  By pulling back from combat, and having a brief interaction with each Enforcer, they can grant short lived benefits to each member.  Each enforcer can receive only one buff, each buff can only be handed out once, and the number of buffs given out is equal to the number of Enforcers present.  The following effects can be given out:

    * “Grant +2 Maximum Armor Points”
    * “Grant +2 Base Spike Damage”
    * “Refresh Any Spell Slot”
    * “Grant Protect vs Weapons”
    * “Grant Protect vs Materia”
