description: |
  The surgeon is skilled at field-work, and  can help pick up somebody on the battlefield by quickly stitching their wounds shut. The process is painful and usually involves quite a bit of discomfort on the recipient’s part - after a Quick Count of 10 role-playing stitching the wounds of the target, you may call “ Heal 1 to Dying by Agony, Short Weakness by Agony”.

  If the Surgeon uses this Power on someone they believe to be one of their Ringleader’s Enforcers, they have the option to take their time and spend a Quick Count of 30 stitching, rather than only 10.  For this, the Call is “Heal 3 to Dying by Agony” instead.
