description: Once per Event, the Spymaster can give a note to Staff with a single question on it.  The note should mention that the note is using the Spymaster Power “Learn the Answers” and, if desired, an explanation of how the Spymaster’s agents might attempt to get the answer.   At some time later (at the discretion and availability of Staff) they should get a response to the Spymaster.  The answer should be based on what spies and agents might be able to learn.  The answer is not guaranteed to be truthful, or clear.
