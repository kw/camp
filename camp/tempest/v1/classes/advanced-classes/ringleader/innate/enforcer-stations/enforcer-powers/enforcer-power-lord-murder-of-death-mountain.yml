description: |
  A surge of unnatural power courses through The Warlord’s veins - probably because they know their boss is watching and they’ve got an image to uphold.

  By stating their name, station, title, ranks, kill count, or otherwise imposing their own power, the Warlord is able to hype themselves up for the coming conflict.

  Until the next Short Rest, or five Weapon attacks have been made, The Warlord may increase their base damage by +2.
