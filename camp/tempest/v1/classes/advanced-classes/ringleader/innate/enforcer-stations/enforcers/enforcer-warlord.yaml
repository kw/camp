name: The Warlord
grants:
  - enforcer-power-lord-murder-of-death-mountain
  - ringleader-power-master-tactician
description: It’s not uncommon for Ringleaders to designate a right hand as their figurehead. These imposing, typically martially adept figures are the strong arm of the Ringleader’s will, but, most of the time, it simply looks like the Warlord is the boss. Some Ringleaders consider this a feature rather than flaw, as when the rival gangs start making moves on dismantling your posse, the Warlord is probably going to get first dibs on the shiv.
