description: |
  One of the best advantages of a Surgeon is their mastery of the living body. A Ringleader may use this knowledge to extract useful information out of those unwilling to speak otherwise.

  The Ringleader may deal Piercing 1 by Agony to a Helpless but conscious character by role-playing some kind of minor torture for 5 seconds or so. If the character takes the damage or otherwise does not Prevent it, the Ringleader may require the target to answer one of the following questions:
    * “Who sent you?”
    * “Who is your boss?”
    * “Who, or what, are you after?”
    * “Do you have more allies in the area?”
    * “Can you be bribed to work for me, instead?”
