description: |
  Knowing a target’s weaknesses is fundamental to planning an attack. The more that is known, the better the outcome is likely to be. By engaging the mark beforehand, important information can be gleaned.

  Out of Combat, The Ringleader may ask the following Discerns (once per Short Rest):

    * “Are you immune or resistant to the Fear Accent?”
    * “Are you immune or resistant to the Agony Accent?”
    * “What are your Current Life Points?”
    * “Do you have any Weapons on you?”

  In addition, on a Marshaled encounter, such as a mod, before the encounter begins you may ask the Marshal each of these (once per Long Rest):

    * “Are there traps present in this encounter?”
    * “Do I sense the presence of a potential rivaling force?”
    * “Are there other entrances I should know about?“
