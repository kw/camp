description: Patience is not really a Ringleader’s strong suit, but, sometimes, that’s okay. The Ringleader may instruct another to turn their hourglass over while crafting an item, shortening the time it takes to create an item. A Ringleader may use this Power a number of times each Short Rest equal to their Ringleader class-level.
