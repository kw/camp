description: |
  Small cottage houses and warm hearths aren’t really up to par for most Ringleaders - the bigger the building the greater the boss, and most Ringleaders make their home in a massive villa or armored fortress.

  The Ringleader gains the Hearth, Protected Hearth, and Bolthole Perks, as well as the following benefit:

  Whenever the Ringleader witnesses a creature remove charges from a Haven for which the Ringleader belongs or is currently inside, they may Call “[Name or Description], Piercing 2 by Fear” to that creature.
