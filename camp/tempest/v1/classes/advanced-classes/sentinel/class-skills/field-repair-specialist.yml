description: |
  Knowing how to properly maintain one’s equipment can mean the difference between life and death. The Sentinel gains a pool of Maintenance Points equal to 10 plus their Sentinel class-level that refreshes upon the completion of a Long Rest. They may spend a Focus Quick 100 roleplaying patching their own armor or shield and use any amount of Points to apply them as Mending to their worn armor or wielded shield.

  When the character triggers the [Reinforce] keyword, they gain two Maintenance Points.
