description: |
  Under all of their armor, the Sentinel develops their body to be as resilient of a defense as their normal protections. The Sentinel’s Maximum Life Points increase by one. This is a Base change, and does not interact with Stacking rules.

  Additionally, once per Long Rest when the Sentinel would be reduced to zero Life Points, they can Counter the damage by calling “Counter: Resolute”.  This will leave the character at 1 Life Point.
