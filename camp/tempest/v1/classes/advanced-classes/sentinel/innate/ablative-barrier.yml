description: |
  The Sentinel has learned to use defenses that normally turn aside more mundane attacks to stop even the most esoteric and magical assault.

  The Sentinel can only use this Power if they have points of Barrier. They Sacrifice all remaining points of Barrier, and may call “Counter, Deflect” to a single Effect.
