description: |
  The Sentinel learns to utilize every trick they have in broader strokes - what was once a narrow defensive option becomes a tool to use against all the ails of the world.

  Any powers that the Sentinel possess that grant Counters or Resistances to Wounding or Piercing effects lose that restriction, and may be used against any damaging attacks.
