description: |
  The Sentinel knows their job: to be an anchor along the line, and the heart of fighting. To that end, they grind the enemy’s advance or retreat around them to a crawl. Until the end of a Short Rest, while in Sentinel’s Stance, the Sentinel may at-will swing for “Quick Slow by Force.”
