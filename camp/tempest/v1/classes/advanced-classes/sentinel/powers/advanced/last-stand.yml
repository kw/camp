description: |
  When the Sentinel would be put into a dying state (Ex: reduced to zero Life Points), they may instead Heal to Full and gain the Inherent rooted Condition until they enter the dying state again.

  Once the Sentinel can no longer perceive a known hostile threat, they are immediately reduced to zero Life Points and begin dying.
