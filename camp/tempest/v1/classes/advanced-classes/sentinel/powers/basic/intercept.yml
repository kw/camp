  The Sentinel touches another they are trying to protect in this battle. The recipient gains the power to Counter a melee attack as long as they are in melee range of the Sentinel who used this power on them.

  The recipient calls “Counter, Intercept” when they use this counter. All of this needs to be explained to the recipient.
