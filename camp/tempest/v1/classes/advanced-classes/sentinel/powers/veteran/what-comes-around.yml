description:
  After a career of absorbing punishment, the Sentinel learns how to not just mitigate, but redirect some of that punishment. After resisting damage, or using Counter (including Protect) against a damaging attack or Power, the Sentinel can immediately make a Wounding attack for the amount of damage negated. This has no effect if the Resist or Counter did not mitigate damage.
