description: |
  There are a number of times in which the various protections that can be granted to a Sentinel by themselves or others go unused - perhaps they bring a Protection potion against Poison and discover they are opposed by elementals, or perhaps they have a friend Grant them Protection against Materia and are in a duel with a powerful fighter.

  When used, this Power lets the Sentinel sacrifice a Protection they have on them to Grant themselves 3 Barrier.
