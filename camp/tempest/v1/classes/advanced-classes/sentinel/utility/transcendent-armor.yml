description: |
  The Sentinelsâ€™ armor takes on nearly living quality, reacting to the needs of the Sentinel and knitting itself back together when provided the energy necessary to do so.

  The Sentinel, when granted points of Barrier, may also choose to Mend their armor or shield for the same number of Barrier points that they were given
