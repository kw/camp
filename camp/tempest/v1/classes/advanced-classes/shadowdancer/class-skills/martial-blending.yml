description:
  The Shadowdancer may expend a Basic or Advanced Rogue or Shadowdancer Power to Cast Umbral Fade (provided they have access to it otherwise). If the Shadowdancer expends a Power in this way it does not Refresh until their next Long Rest regardless of its normal refresh.

  In addition, when Short Resting the Shadowdancer may expend a Novice or higher Spell-slot to Refresh a Martial Power that was used to grant them the Umbral Fade Power from above.
