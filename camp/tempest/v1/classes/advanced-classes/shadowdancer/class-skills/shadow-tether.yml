  While all Shadowdancers have connections to the umbral realms, those gifted with the arcane from a Source can simply choose to never close that connection, leaving a conduit to channel power from at all times.

  When gaining this Power, the Shadowdancer may choose to use the Darkness Accent anywhere a Power would allow the substitution of an Eldritch Accent.
