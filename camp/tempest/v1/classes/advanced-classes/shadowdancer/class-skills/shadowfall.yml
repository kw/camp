description: |
  The character can Counter the damage and Effects from one fall.

  For Example: Avana, climbing across a narrow ledge, slips and falls forty feet to the sharp rocks below, normally taking 10 damage and a Disable to both legs. Instead, she calls “Counter, Shadowfall” and takes no falling damage or Effects instead.
