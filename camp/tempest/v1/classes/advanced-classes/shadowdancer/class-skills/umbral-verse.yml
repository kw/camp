description: |
  The darkness of the night is but a mere shadow to the all-encompassing void that is the maelstrom, but that does not mean they are ill-acquainted. Reaching into the Umbral Weave, the Dark’s taint may be subtly altered to suit the whims of the Shadowdancer.

  Note: Use of this Power during crafting will not otherwise disrupt or affect the crafting process or ritual, however, adding to the Dark Territory (“Short Grant +1 Dark Territory”) will automatically make the process require a marshal.
