description: |
  When the body and spirit of the Shadowdancer is between worlds, this uncertain state can be exploited to leave behind the ills of less-benign substances that would taint the being of the Shadowdancer.

  When returning to a substantial state (such as being Cured or Dispelled of an insubstantial Condition), the Shadowdancer may also rid themselves of the ills of Corrupted Alchemy.
