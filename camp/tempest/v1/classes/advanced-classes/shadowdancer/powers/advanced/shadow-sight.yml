description: |
  While everyday objects and people take great measures to conceal the reality of themselves, few pay attention to have their shadow-selves dance about them. The Shadowdancer is aware that where the mask of light is often impenetrable, the shadow self is all too eager to spill its secrets.

  The Shadowdancer may, if a creature or object is casting a significant shadow, choose to scrutinize this shadow and ask it a simple question, sure that the answer will be true. After completing a Focus Quick 100, the Shadowdancer may ask a question per the skill “Insight” to a Marshal. This ability is refreshed when the Shadowdancer exits the insubstantial condition.

  In addition, at night, or when entirely in shadow, the Shadowdancer gains the Sight Perk, or if they already have Sight, Sight Beyond Sight is granted instead.
