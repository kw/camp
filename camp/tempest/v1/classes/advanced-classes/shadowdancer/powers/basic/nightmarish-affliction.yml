  Calling upon the horrors that lurk in the minds of mortals, the Shadowdancer can cause their foes to see nightmarish illusions in place of friend and foe alike.

  Immediately after losing the insubstantial Condition, the Shadowdancer gains a single charge of “Short Berserk by Darkness.” Should the Shadowdancer complete a Short Rest, become Helpless, or use any other Power, this charge is lost.
