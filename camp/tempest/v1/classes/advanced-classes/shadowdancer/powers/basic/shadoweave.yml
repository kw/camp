description: |
  When necessary, the Shadowdancer is capable of crafting the tools they need from the raw darkness that surrounds them. The Shadowdancer may select a currently wielded weapon and call the Darkness Accent with all attacks made with that weapon until the end of a Long Rest.

  In addition, if the wielded weapon is broken (Shattered, etc), Rebuild it. The Rebuild on the weapon is permanent.

  To Rebuild the weapon, the Shadowdancer must RP for a Quick 30 fixing the weapon. This can be done once per Short Rest.
