description: |
  After inscribing a personal rune, the Shadowdancer disconnects their shadow from themselves creating a duplicate form they control. This new form is barely there, and easy to disrupt, but as long as it exists, the Shadowdancer perceives the world through it.

  In effect, the Shadowdancer disappears and is replaced by this duplicate - once the duplicate takes any Effect that does not have a Target of Self the duplicate is Dispelled, calling “Immune, Shadow Duplicate” to the Effect that caused the disruption, and the inhabiting spirit is whisked back to the rune: the character becomes insubstantial and must immediately return to the rune, and there call “Dispel Insubstantial to Self.”
