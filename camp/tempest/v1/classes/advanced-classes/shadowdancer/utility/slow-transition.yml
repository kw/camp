description: |
  The Shadowdancer is so at home in the intangible shroud of the dark that even when they re-emerge into the normal world, they draw with them some of the protection of their former insubstantial state.

  When the Shadowdancer leaves an insubstantial state, they gain a number of Counters versus Weapons equal to their Shadowdancer class-levels that must be used each time the Shadowdancer takes a Weapon attack until they are used up. If the defense is forgotten or otherwise not used, the charge is lost.
