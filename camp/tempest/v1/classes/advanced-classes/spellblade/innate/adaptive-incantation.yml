  The Spellblade may use the Novice, Adept, or Greater level incantations from any casting class they have levels in interchangeably. The Spellblade may also use a custom incantation they purchased with Service Points interchangeably as though it were a base incantation above.

  In addition, the Spellblade counts as both a Martial and an Arcane Spellcasting class for the purposes of Powers that depend on those class-level counts.
