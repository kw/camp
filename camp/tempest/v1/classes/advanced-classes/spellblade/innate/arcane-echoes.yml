  The Spellblade can activate a link between themselves and the target of their magic. Until they complete a Short Rest, each time they successfully use a Packet or Weapon Spell (Not Cantrip) and it is not Prevented, they will Heal 1 Life Point and gain 1 Shard Point. Shard Points and Healing are only gained for the first charge from a given Spell that is not Prevented; additional charges of the same Spell do not give additional benefit.

  So if a Spellblade had three charges of “Wounding 3 by Flame” on a weapon, and the first was Countered, but the second was not, they could gain 1 Shard Point and Heal 1. If the third attack was also effective, no further Shard Points or Healing would be gained.

  While Arcane Echoes is active, the character’s Shard Point maximum is 20 and they can spend up to 10 Shard points at a time. While Arcane Echoes is active, they have the following additional Shard point options:

    * 10 Shards

      * Grant +1 base damage to self with weapon attacks until they complete a Short Rest. The character cannot benefit from having this bonus more than once.
      * “[Name or Description x4] Short Root” (“You, you, you, and you: Short Root”)
      * “Dispel all Conditions” by Weapon Attack
