description: |
  The Spellblade gains +1 Base Damage while using a staff. In addition, they may, at-will, expend a Spike while using a staff in both hands to do a Disarm Effect with a Weapon Delivery.

  Lastly, once per Short Rest, when the Spellblade uses Bladechannel to put a Novice Spell onto a weapon, the Spellblade can discharge the Spell once from the Staff without expending the charge (meaning that it effectively has two charges for every charge put into the Staff).
