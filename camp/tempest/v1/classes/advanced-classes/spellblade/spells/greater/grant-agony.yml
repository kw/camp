description:
  Grant Agony strokes the target with pure pain, reaching into their heart and head and laying in lances of ice and fire. This Spell charges two Spell-Balls at the same time which must be thrown separately. The target cannot concentrate or do much at all, torn apart from the inside out by phantom knives.
