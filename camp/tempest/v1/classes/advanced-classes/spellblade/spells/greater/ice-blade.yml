description: |
  The Spellblade is infused with the ability to do “Wounding 2 by Ice” with their weapons, but gains a Selective Resistance to Healing. The character can end the Spell at any time by Calling any damage for a weapon attack other than “Wounding 2 by Ice”, changing the Accent, or by taking Healing and not Resisting it.

  Note: The Caster is the target, so this does not activate the Counterblade Skill.
