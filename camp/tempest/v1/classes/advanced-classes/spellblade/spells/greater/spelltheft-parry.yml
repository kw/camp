description:
  This spell is cast on the Spellblade’s weapon and will remain active until the Spellblade completes a Short Rest, becomes Helpless, or stops wielding the weapon. The weapon is capable of stealing an attack used against it. After the Spellblade is hit with a Packet or Verbal attack (Effect or Damage), the Spellblade can call “Counter, Spelltheft!” and then may, at any time while the spell is still active, make a melee attack with the enhanced weapon that has the exact same Call as the attack that was Countered.
