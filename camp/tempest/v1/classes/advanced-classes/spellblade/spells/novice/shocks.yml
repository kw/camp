description:
  This Spell charges three Spell-Balls with small bolts of lightning. If a Spell-Ball is not Prevented, the caster immediately charges their weapon with a melee attack that does “Wounding 1 by Lightning.” The caster can have up to three of these charges on their Weapon at a time from this spell. Charging a weapon in this way does not discharge any of the other Spell-Balls charged with this spell.
