description: |
  This minor cantrip charges a packet of Materia causing one damage by either Force or Radiance Accent, chosen by the caster at the time of casting. If this packet strikes a conscious enemy target and is not Prevented, the Caster may add 1 to their Healing Touch pool or Life Tap pool if they have one.

  Note: Players should use their best judgment as to what an “enemy” is and this cantrip should not be used on their allies to regain Healing Touch or Life Tap pool.
