description:
  A Universalist may convert Healing Touch Pool or Life Tap Pool points into Force damage. The largest number that may be thrown in a single packet is equal to the character’s Universalist class-level. If the Universalist has the Mage Bolt Cantrip the first point of Force damage from Mass Effect does not subtract from the Healing Touch or Life Tap pool.
