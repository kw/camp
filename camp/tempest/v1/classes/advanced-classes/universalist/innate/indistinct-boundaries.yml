  Recognizing that the fundamental nature of magic is its mutability, the way the Universalist calls it forth can vary from caster to caster.

  The Universalist may use the Novice or Adept level base incantations from Cleric, Druid, Mage, Sourcerer, and Universalist interchangeably. The Universalist may also use a custom incantation they purchased with Service Points interchangeably as though it were a base incantation above.

  Normally, spell casters learn a single spell each level they attain. Universalists instead receive 1 Arcane and 1 Divine spell at each level of Universalist (Universalist spells count as either Arcane or Divine for this purpose).
