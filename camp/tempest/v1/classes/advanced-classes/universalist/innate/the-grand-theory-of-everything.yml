  Delving into the deepest realms of the foundations of magic, the Universalist surfaces from their research fundamentally altered: They view magic of the Arcane and Divine as one, transmuting between the two with an ease that befuddles even their most learned peers.

  Starting at class-level five, Universalists count Universalist levels as class-levels of Cleric, Druid, Mage, and Sourcerer for the following Cantrips, Spells, and Powers:

    * Eldritch Bolt
    * Greater Healing Touch
    * Healing Touch
    * Life Tap

  This change retroactively applies to all levels of Universalist.

  Finally, the Universalist may choose to gain one of the following Base Class level 10 Archetype Powers:

    * Boon From the Gods
    * Channel the Arcane
    * Grove
    * Power of Magic
