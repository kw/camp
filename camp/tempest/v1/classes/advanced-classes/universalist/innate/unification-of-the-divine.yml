  The Universalist’s understanding of the artificial barriers between Arcane and Divine magic allows them to “bend the rules” in a way that few can replicate. This allows the Universalist to substitute the Radiance Accent for the Force accent and the Force accent for the Radiance Accent at will.

  Universalists may cast Arcane spells from Divine Spell slots and Divine spells from Arcane spell slots for spells of the Novice, Adept, and Greater Tiers.

  Uses of Refreshing Prayer, Commune with Nature, Arcane Study, and Eldritch Battery will now refresh both their Arcane and Divine spell slots.  The practical effect of this is allowing a Universalist a second full spell refresh per long rest by using an Arcane refresh, then a Divine refresh to restore all of their spell slots.

  Finally, the Universalist may count an Arcane Locus as Consecrated Ground or vice versa for the purpose of refreshing additional spells during rest, but only one of the two at a time.  If the character has Concurrent Meditation, they may gain both sets of additional spell slots at the same time.
