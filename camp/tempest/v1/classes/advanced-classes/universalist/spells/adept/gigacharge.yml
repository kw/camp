description: |
  The Universalist uses their own magical barrier to blast a foe: they channel all barrier they have, turning that energy against their foe.

  When this spell is cast, the Universalist Sacrifices all Barrier they currently possess. They then may immediately charge a spell-ball with Wounding [X] by Lightning or Force, where [X] is the amount of Barrier sacrificed, plus 4.

  If the Universalist has a Source providing the Eldritch Accent of Lightning or Illusion they do not need to Sacrifice their current Barrier and instead simply do Wounding 4 plus the current amount of Barrier they have to the target.
