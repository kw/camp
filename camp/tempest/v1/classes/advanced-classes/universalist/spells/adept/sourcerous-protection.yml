description: |
  The Universalist throws up a shield of arcane energy to protect up to a number of individuals equal to their Mage class-levels against their Eldritch Accent or Arcane.

  Additionally, the Universalist may grant a single individual a Protect vs Verbal. If the Universalist has an active Form Spell they may instead grant a single individual a Protect vs Verbal and Voice.

  Replicate Enhancement works on this spell, and adds targets to each class of Protect afforded by this spell.
