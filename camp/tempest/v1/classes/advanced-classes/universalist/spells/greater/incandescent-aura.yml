description: |
  When casting this spell, the Universalist may brandish pure magical energy in their hands, and plant their feet. As long as the Universalist does not move their feet, they may charge spell-balls by simply holding it and calling "Spell-ball Charged!" with “Short Repel by Arcane.” Only one spell-ball may be charged at a time.

  The Universalist may also use this spell to heal.  As long as the Universalist does not move their feet, they may charge spell-packets at-will by simply holding it and calling "Spell-packet Charged!" with “Heal 1 by Arcane.” Only one spell-packet may be charged at a time.

  If the Universalist has a Source they may change the accent of either type of spell-packet from Arcane to their Eldritch Accent at-will.

  The spell ends when the Universalist moves their feet, casts another spell, becomes Helpless, or takes a Short Rest.
