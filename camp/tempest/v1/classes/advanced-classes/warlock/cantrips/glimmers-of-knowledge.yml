  This power taps into the innate understanding of higher powers common to Warlocks. When cast, the Warlock may use each of these Discerns once against any valid target before a Long Rest. If the Discern is Prevented (“Counter”, “No Effect”, etc), the specific Discern Prevented regains its charge, and may be used against another valid target.
