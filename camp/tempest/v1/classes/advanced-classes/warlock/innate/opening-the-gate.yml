description:
  Whenever the Warlock casts a Spell from an Arcane spell list that does damage, they may expend a Spike during the casting (even if they have already expended a Spike during the normal casting of the spell) to increase the damage of the first Spell-Ball used by that spell by one if it does Piercing, two if it does Wounding, or by three if it is normal damage.
