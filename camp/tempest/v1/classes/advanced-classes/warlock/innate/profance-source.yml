description: |
  Warlocks utilize Sources as their spellcasting foci. This Power works in all ways as the Sourcerer ability Eldritch Source, and is a requirement for all Warlock Spells. If the character already has an Eldritch Source (such as the Sourcererâ€™s Eldritch Source), this ability grants an additional Eldritch Source.

  In addition, the Warlock may use the Warlock Incant for all Arcane spell Incantations, should the character so choose.
