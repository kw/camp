description:
  Until the Warlock’s next Short Rest, each time the caster lands a cantrip or spell with a packet delivery with the Acid Accent on a conscious foe and the target doesn’t prevent it, the caster may call "Charged." Then the next time the caster is hit by a melee attack they may call against the person that hit them "[Name or Description] 2 Acid.” You may have charges equal to your Arcane Spellcaster class-levels at a time.
