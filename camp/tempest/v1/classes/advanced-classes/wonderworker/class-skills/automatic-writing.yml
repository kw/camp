description: |
  One of the first symbols of civilization lies in front of so many of the unsuspecting - the written word. The Wonderworker has developed connections to the written word not dissimilar to that of a medium, and can call upon latent spirits to provide information beyond normal means of acquisition.

  The Wonderworker must contact Staff to use this power. Plot will write a short and cryptic but factually accurate message to the Wonderworkerâ€™s player, sealed (ideally marked with both a white halo and a black keyhole sigil and the Wonderworkers name). The Wonderworker then can re-enter game and perform some kind of roleplay to represent receiving this message - common versions might be trapping chalk between two slates and shaking them, or entering a trance and scribbling madly on parchment. After this roleplay is performed, the message can be unsealed and read.

  This Power will usually only be usable once per Event, but it is possible that Plot will be able to provide multiple messages.
