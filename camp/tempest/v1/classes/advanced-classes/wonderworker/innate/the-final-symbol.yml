  After so much time of discovery, it is almost a surprise that the Wonderworker can find time to dedicate to learning the deeper secrets of another symbol. And yet, the Wonderworker will live up to their name.

  The Wonderworker gains access to another Symbol of their choice, detailed below  in the “Wonderworker Symbols” section as well as access to the Gateway Power from that symbol. This choice is permanent, and reflects the character’s path of study through the esoteric knowledge they have discovered.
