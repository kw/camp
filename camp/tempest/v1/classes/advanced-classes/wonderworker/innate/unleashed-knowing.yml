description: |
  At the pinnacle of their power, the Wonderworker is confronted with a choice. They can study their symbols broadly, and unlock power across several of the symbols. Or, they can delve deeply into their powers, and find a path to a profound occult secret of one of their symbols. The choice is theirs, and is never taken lightly.

  The Wonderworker has a choice to make:

    * Either they gain access to the Prime Power from a Symbol they already have the Deeper Power from and a Deeper Power from another Symbol they already have the Gateway Power from; or,
    * They gain access to two Deeper Powers from two of their unlocked Symbols.

  This choice is permanent, and reflects the characterâ€™s path of study through the esoteric knowledge they have discovered.
