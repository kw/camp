description: |
  A mirror is a symbol of illusions and unreality - by keeping one close at hand, the Wonderworker can tap into those distortions of reality.

  The Wonderworker can briefly “Fracture” their form, Countering a Weapon or Packet. They then immediately Grant themselves a brief insubstantial that they can Cure after a Quick 100 Count by Calling “Cure insubstantial”.
