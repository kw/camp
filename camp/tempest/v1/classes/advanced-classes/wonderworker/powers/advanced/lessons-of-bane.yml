  While there are a few lone wolves among Wonderworkers, even they will acknowledge the advantages of working with others. With this power, the Wonderworker can take their talents and help others perform even better.

  The Wonderworker may use any Accent that they are currently capable of Delivering by use of any of their Powers, and confer that power to a number of allies equal to the Wonderworkers class-level with a “Short Grant [Accent].”
