  Books are gateways to knowledge that one does not possess, and the Wonderworker can turn any book into a skeleton key for those doors.

  The Wonderworker starts by sitting down to read a book, or a set of scrolls, or any similar prop that might convey knowledge. After they finish their reading, which should take about 5 minutes, they temporarily retain some knowledge that they might not normally have access to: until the next Long Rest, the Wonderworker can treat themselves as having a Lore skill they do not normally have, selected at the end of their reading.

  Additionally, the Wonderworker’s readings might help them recall otherwise unknown elements about those around them, both friend and foe alike. The Wonderworker gains a number of Discerns equal to the Wonderworker’s Class level, which may be used in the following ways:

    * “What is one Power that you possess?”
    * “What is one Spell that you possess?”
    * “What is one active Grant on your person?”
    * “What is one active Protect That you possess?”
