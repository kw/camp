  One of the fundamental truths of the Tempest and the Eyes is that everything, no matter how frail or mighty, has a weakness. The Wonderworker has trained themselves to find a connection to that weakness, and use what they have on their person to link to - and use - that weakness. Sometimes the weaknesses are obvious - connecting the symbol of Highlord Aeterius to channel radiance against a creature of darkness. Sometimes it is less so - the broken chains of a freed man against a tyrant would suffice for a sufficiently talented Wonderworker.

  The Wonderworker must first pick a target and use the Discern portion of this power. If the target gives them a valid weakness, the Wonderworker may then take a moment to find an appropriate Symbol to Grant themselves the appropriate Accent against only that target. The Wonderworker must have at least Gateway access to the correct Symbol to utilize it for the corresponding Accent. If the target does not provide a vulnerability or provides a vulnerability that is not covered on the following list such as Maelstrom or Malediction this power immediately refreshes.  

  Additionally, if the target is defeated during the short Grant from this power, Exploit Weakness recharges and may be used on another target. The list of Accents that may be Granted and their corresponding Symbols is below:

    * The Weapon: Agony, Force, Acid
    * The Lantern: Radiance, Illusion, Wlll
    * The Wand: Mind, Time, Flame
    * The Talisman: Darkness, Fear, Poison
    * The Gem: Arcane, Lightning, Ice
