  By writing down an individual’s name in a tome and roleplaying sealing it, the Wonderworker can help defend them against powers that would seek out that person specifically. The Wonderworker grants the target a Protect that is used exclusively on a Verbal-Delivery Power.  Once per Long Rest, the Wonderworker may Grant any individual a Protect vs Verbal by Touch after writing the name and sealing it.
