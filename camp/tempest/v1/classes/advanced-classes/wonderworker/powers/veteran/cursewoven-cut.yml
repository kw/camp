description: |
  Wonderworkers are in tune with the workings of the universe, and a well-trained Wonderworker can act to disrupt a victim in such a way that one of the workings of the universe becomes anathema to their being. The Wonderworker makes a weapon attack, and Grants the target a vulnerability to one of the following Accents: Acid, Arcane, Darkness, Flame, Force, Ice, Lightning, Radiance, or Time.
