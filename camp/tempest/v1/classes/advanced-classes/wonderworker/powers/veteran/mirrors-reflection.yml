description: |
  A mirror shows something in a different place - and the Wonderworker can tap into this to reflect themselves elsewhere.

  In order to invoke this Power, the Wonderworker must utilize a reflection at least large enough to fully reflect their face - a polished coin is not sufficient to channel a reflection. Once per Wonderworker Class-level per Short Rest, the Wonderworker may grant themselves Short insubstantial. This insubstantial can be voluntarily cured by the Wonderworker if they utilize a reflection in the same method as how they entered the insubstantial state.
