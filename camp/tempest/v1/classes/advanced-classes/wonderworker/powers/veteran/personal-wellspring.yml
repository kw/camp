description: |
  Magic items resonate with the essence of those who wield them. By working with that connection, a Wonderworker can push a magic item’s normal powers past its limits.

  In order to use this Power, the Wonderworker charges a weapon attack or Spell. This can be a normal, unaccented attack or any other Spell or Power enhanced attack. If that attack strikes a target, the Wonderworker fills themself with power until their next Short Rest.

  The Wonderworker may expend this charge to utilize an expended Carded Item Power that has a Refresh of Short, Long, or Event. If the Power refreshed has a normal refresh of Event, this Power may only be used on that item once per Event.
