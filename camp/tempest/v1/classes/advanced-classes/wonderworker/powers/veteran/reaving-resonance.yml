description: |
  Wonderworkers have the capacity to interact with the world at a level usually only accessed by those wielding arcane arts. By tapping into that flow of power, they can add disruptive force to one of their interactions with the world.

  The wonderworker can expend this power to add +3 damage and the Arcane Accent to any power that deals damage with a delivery of Weapon, Touch, Spell-Packet, or Spell-Ball - effecting only the first swing or charge of a power.  This power supercedes all rules preventing the increase of damage of powers.
