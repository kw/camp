  When you first gain this power, select an additional elemental Accent from among the four listed in Magic Collector. You may select this new element when using the Wand.

  When you charge a Spell Ball with Magic Collector, you may instead of calling damage expend a Spike and Call one of the following effects:

    * Acid: “Shatter [item] by Acid.” If the packet strikes a specific item like a shield or a weapon, the item must be called as the target.
    * Flame: “Quick Disable [Limb] by Flame”
    * Ice: “Quick Root by Ice”
    * Lightning: “Short Repel by Lightning”
