name: Echo Weapon [The Weapon]

call: "“[Name or Description], [Weapon Attack Call]”"
target: Individual
duration: Instantaneous
delivery: Verbal
refresh: Short Rest
accent: Special
effect: Special
description: The greatest strength of a weapon is, in some sense, the most simple advice that one is given when practicing and fighting with any weapon - do it again. The Wonderworker, until the next Short Rest or until this Power is used, may repeat their most recently expended Weapon-delivered Attack or Effect as a Verbal Delivery Attack to the same target - “[Name or Description], [Weapon Attack Call].” The original attack only has to have been directed at the named or described target - it does not have to have succeeded, or even entirely hit the target. Unsuccessful attempts are just practice, after all.
