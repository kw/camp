  Connections exist in the world in ways that go far deeper than most folk know. A ritual to speak with a lost loved one might touch upon a lost domain of one of the deities, an act of faith may call to unforeseen eyes, an old weapon may have crossed blades and fates with the champion of a lost empire - the skein of fate is a hapless tangle of threads, of which countless crossings could be traced by one who cares to look. Either by chance or purpose, you have found a particularly strong version of those crossings, granting you insight into the unseen connections of the world and some degree of capacity to use them to your own ends.

  Some Wonderworkers are soothsayers who have stumbled upon deeper secrets than they were meant to learn. Some are hunters of things that don't belong in the world, who have been forced to find solutions where others failed to look. What all Wonderworkers have in common is this - they now take connections that might be mundane in the hands of another person, and they make wondrous things happen.

  Much of what a Wonderworker does is with symbols and their connections, represented by five major symbols in the world. The weapon has connections with conflict and attack. The lantern has connections with revelations and light, and those seeking knowledge. The wand is the symbol of the arcane tradition, and the power of spellcasters. The talisman is the symbol of faith and the faithful, and a mark of protection. Finally, the trappings are the symbol of leadership and leaders.

  All Wonderworkers are at heart a kind of dabbler, exploring several paths. Some Wonderworkers will spread out their focus, dabbling in the symbols of several concepts. Others will dive deeper into a single idea, finding deeper meaning and powers. Very few Wonderworkers are the same, and it might be hard to tell that they even follow the same path!
