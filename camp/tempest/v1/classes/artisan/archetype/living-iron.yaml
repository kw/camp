description: |
  The Artisan gains a pool of mending that can be used between Long Rests called the Living Iron Pool.
  This Living Iron pool is equal to three times the Artisan's class-level.

  Each time this power is used, the Artisan can Mend armor (physical, summoned, or natural) or shield up
  to the Artisan’s class-level, subtracting the Mending from the Living Iron Pool. Living Iron will not
  work on the Artisan's own worn armor, but will work if the Artisan removes the armor. Remember that a
  shield with 0 Shield Points cannot be mended, and must be Rebuilt.

  For example, a 4th level Artisan would have 12 total points of Mending to give out between Long Rests
  and could use this Power to Mend up to 4 points at a time. There is no limit to the number of points
  that can be in this pool; however, the pool resets to three times the Artisan’s class-level at the end
  of a Long Rest. Note that if this Power is gained by a non-Artisan, the amount of Mending is still
  determined by the number of Artisan class-levels, i.e. zero.

  Artisans that have more [Artificer] tagged powers than [Crafter] or [Mystic] Artisan powers gain
  additional points to their Living Iron pool based on the amounts below.

  - If the Artisan has at least 5 [Artificer] tagged Artisan powers (Basic, Advanced, or Utility)
    the Artisan gains four times the Artisan's class-level per Long Rest.
  - If the Artisan has at least 8 [Artificer] tagged Artisan powers (Basic, Advanced, or Utility)
    the Artisan gains five times the Artisan's class-level per Long Rest.
  - If the Artisan has at least 11 [Artificer] tagged Artisan powers (Basic, Advanced, or Utility)
    the Artisan gains six times the Artisan's class-level per Long Rest.
