  It is difficult to simply define an Artisan. Certainly many are actual makers of art, such as painters and sculptors, while
  others are Artisans in a more “craftsperson” sense, building mechanical devices, exploring the dark corners of alchemy, or
  mastering the planar dance of enchanting. These examples only begin to encompass the kinds of arts available though. Chefs,
  chocolatiers, draftspersons, and masters of engineering all fall under the wide umbrella that are Artisans.

  From S.J. Waters, an Engineer in Niven and Barnes’ Dream Park, to a master gardener like Samwise Gamgee, the kinds of people
  who would be Artisans are myriad. Mad scientists, dedicated scholars, and weird mystics, these characters are unified by their
  love of what they do and their ability to create. Some create knowledge, others exquisite, edible artwork. Those who become
  Champion Artisans are true masters of their art and generally the best crafters in the world.

  Artisans can be found in almost any clothing, but simple, traditional garb is most appropriate. Leather aprons, utility
  gloves, and pouches full of tools and equipment are all common.

  ## Specializations

  ### Artificer

  The combination of human and machine is that the Artificer specializes in. “Ironman, Asami, or James Bond are all examples of
  Artificers who gain power not from inherent super powers or magic, but rather from their gadgets. Artificers are more likely
  to be Tinkers than other crafting specialties and make extensive use of Forgesources which can generally only be prepared once
  every 8 hours. The Artificer is a master of repairing armor and shields in combat, going toe-to-toe with their enemies and
  coming out alive, and taking up space on the battlefield. If you want to play an Artisan that can participate in combat, this
  is the specialization for you!

  ### Crafter

  When it comes to the productive makers, there is no equal to the Crafter. They are a skilled craftsman in their field and excel
  at creating items with more profound and useful benefits than their non-Crafter counterparts. Their toolkit includes many ways
  to alter the items that they have made, or enhance them to give situational mastery over niche encounters.

  ### Mystic

  When the immaterial speaks, it’s not only the Divine who listens. The Mystic is a ritualist who specializes in the casting of
  divine or arcane rituals. While any mage or cleric can pick up a scroll and cast it with an objective understanding of what
  the magic contained may do, it is the Mystic who goes beyond, to enhance themself and their allies farther than that which is
  written on the crumbling parchments of the ritual scroll.
