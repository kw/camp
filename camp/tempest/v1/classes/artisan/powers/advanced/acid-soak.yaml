description: |
  Carefully, the Artisan processes a number reagents in sinister ways, adding their lethal
  humors to soak a spell-ball full of materia in a solution that will react over a few minutes,
  making for a powerfully acidic projectile. The Artisan must work on the packet for a Focus
  Quick 100 and may then throw it at any time. If the spell-ball leaves their hand or touches
  any object other than their hand, it will discharge.

  The Artisan may process up to 3 Night Prizes into this solution. For each Night Prize
  processed in this way, the damage of the call is increased by 2. Thus processing 3 Night
  Prizes would result in a call of "Wounding 8 by Acid."
