description: |
  This Power can only be used out of combat. By expending one Bloom per target, the Artisan can
  provide a powerful curative brew for up to six Individuals, moving from one to the other
  giving each a sip which will heal their wounds and injuries. No one target can be given more
  than one sip. The Artisan must Focus for at least 10 seconds over each character to be
  Treated. All targets are Healed to full Life Points and cured of all conditions. The Bloom
  should be deposited in an Ashbin at the earliest opportunity.

  **Note**: During particular marshaled encounters, such as mods, planar travel, etc, this
  Power may not be available, as the entire encounter may be considered “In-combat.”
