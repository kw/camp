description: |
  The Artisan can prepare a weapon to ignite and explode, by preparing strange fuses, oils, and other ingredients. After the Artisan spends a Quick Count of 100 in deep Focus, role-playing this preparation, the character is ready to detonate their weapon. At any time the target chooses, a melee weapon can be ignited to use the Explosive Impact Power below. This should be explained to the target while the preparations are being made.

  **Note**: The Role-Playing of this Power may include props or equipment given to the target, or infusing the character’s limb with bizarre oils; the exact details are up to the Artisan.
