  The Artisan can give another character the power to ignite a weapon they are using, by
  preparing strange fuses, oils, and other ingredients. After the Artisan spends a slow count
  of 30 role-playing this preparation, the character is ready to detonate their weapon. At any
  time the target chooses, a melee weapon can be ignited to use the Power below. This should be
  explained to the target while the preparations are being made. Note that the Role-Playing of
  this Power may include props or equipment given to the target, or infusing the character’s
  limb with bizarre oils; the exact details are up to the Artisan. A target can have at most
  one ongoing instance of this power at a time.

  effect: Shatter, Wounding
  description: |
    A melee weapon can be used to deliver a Wounding Effect for 8 points of Flame damage. This
    will, unfortunately, also cause a Shatter on the weapon itself and 4 points of Wounding by
    Flame delivered by Touch to the wielder. This damage is not Weapon-delivered and cannot be
    stopped by Effects that stop Weapon attacks. This should be explained to the target while
    the preparations are being made. A weapon may have at most one of these effects on it at
    any time.
