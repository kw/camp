  The Artisan can perform any of the “collection” Plans (Ingot Sheets, Bloom Powder, Night Prize Essence, etc.) regardless of their Crafting Skills. They can perform any of those away from a Crafting Station (but out-of-combat) by spending at least a minute on each one and instead of the normal process substitute their own roleplay choices of crafting the item.
