description: |
  Out of combat, the Artisan can treat a number of projectiles (arrows or crossbow bolts) with
  a special mixture that will cause them to explode on impact. This mixture is concocted by
  sacrificing two Rare Mineral and two Harvest. The Artisan may prepare a number of projectiles
  equal to three times their Artisan class-levels. These projectiles can then be handed out to
  whomever and each of those recipients will be able to the Shield-Breaking Power below that
  many times.

  For example, Samantha creates 12 Exploding Arrows and gives ten to Ajax and two to Triss. At
  any time before Ajax completes a Long Rest, he could fire ten arrows that are Shield-Breaking
  by Flame; Triss could fire two. The exact projectiles do not need to be tracked or used, but
  the actual projectiles must be handed out. The arrow will only work for the person the
  Artisan gives it to, that person may not then pass it on to others. All this needs to be
  explained when the Artisan hands out the arrows.
