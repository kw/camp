description: >
  While in a Ritual, the Artisan may call “Grant Insubstantial to Self” and Focus for a Slow
  300. Once the Count is complete, the Artisan must call “Dispel Insubstantial to Self.”

  While Insubstantial, the Artisan can pause a ritual in progress in which they are the Primary
  Ritualist. If their Focus is broken, the Slow Count is completed, or at the Artisan’s
  discretion, whichever comes first, the Ritual resumes as normal, and the Artisan must call
  “Dispel Insubstantial to Self.” Any actions taken during the Focus period should be ignored
  by the attending Ritual Marshal for the purposes of determining failure or Dark Territory.
