description: |
  The Artisan unravels an Energy Foundation Resource Infusion to treat a weapon, giving it
  properties beyond its normal. This procedure allows the targeted weapon to change to the
  chosen Accent at-will for weapon attacks until they complete a Short Rest. The Artisan may,
  at the time of infusion, choose one of Acid, Flame, Ice, or Lightning.
