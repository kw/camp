  The Artisan gains additional benefits each time they use a Craft of Apprentice level or
  higher (ie: Supervise Armor Mending would not trigger this Power). The Artisan may gain up to
  their Artisan class-levels in the effects below during any one Event. In addition, they may
  gain no more than three instances of any of these effects during an Event.

  * Each time the Artisan completes a Tinkering Plan, they gain 3 to their Living Iron pool.
  * Each time the Artisan completes an Enchanting Ritual, they may gain a Protect vs Packets.
  * Each time the Artisan completes an Alchemy Craft, they gain the ability to reduce a Quick
    100 Count to a Quick 30 Count once.
  * Each Ritual that the Artisan is a Primary or Secondary Ritualist in that is completed
    allows the Artisan to charge a spell-ball with Lightning with the Incantation “I charge
    this with thunder.” The spell-ball will do “Wounding 2 by Lightning” when thrown.
