  The Artisan gains additional benefits each time they use a Craft of Apprentice level or higher (ie: Supervise Armor Mending would not trigger this Power).

  - Each time the Artisan completes a Tinkering Plan, they gain 3 to their Living Iron pool. This has no effect if the Artisan already has more points in their Living Iron Pool than their reset number.
  - Each time the Artisan completes an Enchanting Ritual, they may gain a Protect vs Materia.
  - Each time the Artisan completes an Alchemy Craft, they gain the ability to reduce a Quick 100 Count to a Quick 30 Count once. The Artisan can only have one instance of this active at a time.
  - Each time the Artisan Mends at least 5 Armor at a time, they may also “Grant 2 Barrier” to the person whose armor was Mended.
