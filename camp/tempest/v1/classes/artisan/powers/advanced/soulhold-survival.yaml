description: >
  When the Artisan draws a Foundation Resource - Death that would normally kill them, they can,
  instead, soulhold it. As long as the Foundation Resource - Death is soulheld, the Artisan
  will remain alive, but the moment it ceases being soulheld, the Artisan will take the death
  effect, unless they immediately put the death back in the Weir and redraw.

  If the Artisan uses the Foundation Resource - Death to craft, they will die once they finish
  crafting, or if the Death Foundation Resource is transferred to a Foundation Resource
  Infusion they will survive, but are reduced to zero Life Point, and thus Dying.
