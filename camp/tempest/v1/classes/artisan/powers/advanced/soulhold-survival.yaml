description: |
  When the Artisan draws a Foundation Resource - Death that would normally kill them, they can choose to soulhold it. If they do so, as long as the Foundation Resource - Death is soulheld, the Artisan will remain alive, but the moment it ceases being soulheld, the Artisan will take the Death effect. If the Artisan uses the Foundation Resource - Death to craft, they will die once they finish crafting.
