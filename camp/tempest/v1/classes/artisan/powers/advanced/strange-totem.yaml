  The Artisan prepares special totems and can give them to others. This Power will infuse up to
  six small non-liquid items with the ability to heal. With an explanation, these may then be
  handed out to others, but may not then be re-gifted. By using the item, the character gains
  the ability to heal themself. This healing is taxing, however, and the character will then be
  drained until they complete a Short Rest. The type of totem need not be all the same.

    By using the small, non-liquid totem that they were given by the Artisan, the character
    gains the ability to Heal herself for 1 point before the next time they complete a Long
    Rest. This healing takes a Quick Count of 100, but can be done while the character is
    dying. After the healing is complete, the character is drained until they complete a Short Rest.
