  Through prayers to small/great Gods, energy manipulation, and/or binding of minor spirits, the Mystic imbues up to six non-liquid objects with power that may be gifted to others.

  When bestowed to another, the Mystic explains the totem’s healing properties, and how they are used. The bound powers are non-transferrable, and cannot be regifted. Such power comes with a price, and the life given will take something in return, causing the recipient to be drained until they complete a Short Rest.

  call: '“Heal 1 to Dying, Short Drain to Self”'

    So long as the totem is on your person, you may speak the Incant to Heal 1 to Dying. This healing can be used while Dying and Drains the character until they complete a Short Rest.

    **Note**: If you are unable to speak such as with the Dies Alone Flaw, the incantation cannot be said and thus the Power cannot be invoked.
