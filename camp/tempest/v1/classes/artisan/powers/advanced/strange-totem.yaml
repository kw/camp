  Through prayers to the Gods, energy manipulation, or binding of minor spirits, the Mystic energizes up to six non-liquid objects with power that may be gifted to others. When bestowed to another, the Mystic explains the totem’s healing properties, and how they are used. The bound powers are non-transferrable, and cannot be regifted. Such power comes with a price, and the life given will take something in return, causing the recipient to be drained until they complete a Short Rest. The recipients are granted the Totemic Balm Power below:

    By using the small, non-liquid totem that they were given by the Artisan, the character gains the ability to Heal herself for 1 point before the next time they complete a Long Rest. This healing takes a Quick Count of 100, but can be done while the character is dying. After the healing is complete, the character is drained until they complete a Short Rest.
