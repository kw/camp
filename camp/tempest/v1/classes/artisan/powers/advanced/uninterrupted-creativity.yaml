  While touching a Crafting Station of any kind (Tinker’s Forge, Planar Weir, or Hermetic Workshop) and actively crafting, the Artisan can make others leave them alone to work. They can use this Power an unlimited number of times (but only once per individual), and doing so will not interrupt any Crafting they are doing. The Artisan may only target the same target once per application of this power.
