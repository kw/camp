description: |
  Carefully, the Artisan processes a number of reagents in sinister ways, adding their lethal humours to soak a Spell-Ball full of Materia in a solution that will react over a few seconds, making for a powerfully acidic projectile. The Artisan must work on the Spell-Ball for a Focus Quick 100, sacrificing three Night Prizes, and may then throw it at any time. If the Spell-Ball leaves their hand or touches any object other than their hand, it will discharge. The Night Prizes should be deposited in an Ashbin when convenient.
