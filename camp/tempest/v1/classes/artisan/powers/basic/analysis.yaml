description: |
  The Artisan can inspect any item that has an information card for a Quick Count of 100 and then read the information card. This will not make the character immune to any Effects or consequences (reading a Glyph item card, for example, may mean the Artisan is close enough to set off the Glyph). If there is a Marshal Spirit available, the Marshal Spirit may be asked to give the properties of any item, including ones that do not have information cards, but the information given is up to the attending Marshal Spirit.
  **Note**: This power will reveal only the information available on the card, but not obfuscated effects.
