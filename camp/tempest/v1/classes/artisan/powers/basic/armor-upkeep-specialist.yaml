description: |
  The Artisan can alter a Field Patch Kit they are crafting, instead creating a "Specialist Field Patch Kit" with a 1 year expiration. The Specialist Field Patch Kit can mend armor to full once per Long Rest. This use does not consume the Kit if the Artisan who created it does the repair.

  Maintaining the Specialist Field Patch Kit requires dedicated attention, so the Artisan can only manage one Kit at a time. Furthermore, it will revert to a normal Field Patch Kit if this Power is lost or removed.

  The itemâ€™s card must be updated with these special features.
