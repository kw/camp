description: |
  Normally when an Enchanter creates a scroll using the Scribe Novice Scroll formulae they must use Simple Ink to write the words of the scroll. The Artisan has gained the ability to ignore the alchemical part of this process and scribe the magics onto the hide using their own blood. Using Blood Scroll, the Artisan can ignore the need for Simple Ink for one scroll when they use Scribe Novice Scroll by Sacrificing 1 Life Point of blood.
