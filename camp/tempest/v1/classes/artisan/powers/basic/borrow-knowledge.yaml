description: |
  Out of combat, the Artisan sits down with a willing creature and puts their hands near the
  other’s temples (remember not to touch unless consent has already been explicitly
  established). They should walk the target through a meditation, or explain how they are
  sifting through the other’s skills and talents. When they are done with the role-play, the
  Artisan gains all the Lore skills the target of this Power until completing their next Short
  Rest. The target of the power loses those skills until they complete a Short Rest.
