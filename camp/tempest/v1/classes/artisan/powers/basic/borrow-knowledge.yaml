description: |
  Out of combat, the Artisan sits down with a willing creature and puts their hands near the other’s temples (remember not to touch unless consent has already been explicitly established). They should walk the target through a meditation, or explain how they are sifting through the other’s Skills and talents. When they are done with the role-play, the Artisan Discerns all the Lore Core Skills the target has, and gains all those Skills until they complete a Short Rest.
