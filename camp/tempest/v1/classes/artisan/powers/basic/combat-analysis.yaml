  Once per Short Rest the Artisan must watch an enemy or group of enemies carefully for a Quick Count of 30. Doing so allows the Artisan to Counter one Weapon attack by a member of that group. The Call is “Counter, Dodge”. If the Counter is not used before the Artisan goes out-of-combat or the Artisan completes a Short Rest, it is lost.
