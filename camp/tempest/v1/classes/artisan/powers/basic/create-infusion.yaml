description: |
  Normally when an Enchanter pulls from the Planar Weir the Enchanter may either Soulhold what is pulled or place it in a Foundation Resource Infusion and leave the Planar Weir with it. The Artisan has gained the ability to ignore the alchemical part of this process and through sheer force of will bind the Foundation Resource into a form that is identical to a Foundation Resource Infusion.

  Using this Power, the Artisan can create a Foundation Resource Infusion without any other resources or alchemy when they use Tap Primordial Weir (any level) and may create a Foundation Resource Infusion card for one resource they pulled from the Weir without previously having a Foundation Resource Infusion to store it.
