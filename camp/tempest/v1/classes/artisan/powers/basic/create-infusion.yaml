description: |
  Normally when an Enchanter pulls from the Planar Weir the Enchanter may either Soulhold what
  is pulled or place it in a Foundation Resource Infusion and leave the Planar Weir with it.
  The Artisan has gained the ability to ignore the alchemical part of this process and through
  sheer force of will bind the Foundation Resource into existence so it may leave the Weir as
  normal. Using Create Infusion the Artisan can ignore the need for a Foundation Resource
  Infusion when they use Tap Primordial Weir (any level) and create a card for one resource
  they pulled from the Weir without previously having a Foundation Resource Infusion.
