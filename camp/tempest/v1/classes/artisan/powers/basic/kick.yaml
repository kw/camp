description: |
  An existing potion (any alchemically created liquid or tagged ‘quaffed liquid’) can have a little kick added to it. After spending a Focus Quick 100 adding to, mixing, and enhancing the potion, they may choose one of four benefits that will take place when the potion is imbibed:

  * Heal 1 Life Point
  * Grant 1 Point of Barrier
  * Cure Poison
  * Cause the Intoxicate Effect

  No Potion can be Kicked more than once. Add the Kick effect to the information card or drink it immediately.
