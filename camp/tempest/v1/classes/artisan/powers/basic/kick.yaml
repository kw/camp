description: |
  An Artisan can take an existing potion (any quaffed liquid created with alchemy or tagged quaffed liquid found in the world) and add a little kick to it. After spending a minute or so adding to, mixing, and enhancing the potion, they may choose one of three benefits that will take place when the potion is imbibed:

  - Heal 1
  - Grant 1 Barrier
  - Intoxicate

  No Potion can be Kicked more than once. The Kick effect should be added to the information card for the item if it has one. If there is no information card, either one must be made, or only the Artisan can get the Kick effects.
