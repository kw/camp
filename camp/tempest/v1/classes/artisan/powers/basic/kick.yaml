description: |
  An Artisan can take an existing potion (any quaffed liquid created with alchemy or found in
  the world) and add a little kick to it. After spending a minute or so adding to, mixing, and
  enhancing the potion, they may choose one of four benefits that will take place when the
  potion is imbibed:

  * Heal 1 Life Point
  * Grant 1 Point of Barrier
  * Cure Poison
  * Cause the Intoxicate Effect

  No Potion can be Kicked more than once. The Kick effect should be added to the information
  card for the item if it has one. If there is no information card, either one must be made, or
  only the Artisan can get the Kick effects.
