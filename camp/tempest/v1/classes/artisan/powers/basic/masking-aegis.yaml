description: |
  Cloaked in shadow, the Mystic attempted to draw away the gaze of those who would do harm. The
  Artisan calls upon the deep magics of the realms to draw closed the curtain dividing this
  world and the outer Void. This protection extends only to a single individual, but it is
  enough to divert the attention of dark forces away from the target while they engage in
  Enchanting and Ritual Magic.

  Once the target is appropriately marked, the target’s Dark Territory modifier is reduced by
  one until their next Short Rest. This may reduce their modifier below zero. The target may
  only be the recipient of this boon once per Event from any source.
