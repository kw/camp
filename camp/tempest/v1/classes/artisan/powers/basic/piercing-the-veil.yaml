description: |
  Even a mere candle can be viewed at a great distance in the dead of the night.
  The Artisan calls upon the deep magics of the realms to throw wide the curtain
  dividing this world and the outer Void. This beacon extends only to a single
  individual, but it is enough to attract the attention of dark forces to the
  target while they engage in Enchanting and Ritual Magic.

  Once the target is appropriately marked, the target’s Dark Territory modifier
  is increased by one until their next Long Rest. The target may only be the
  recipient of this boon once per Event from any source.
