description: |
  Carefully, the Artisan breaks down a Forgesource and pours the energy of it over a
  spell-ball full of materia in a solution that will react over a few minutes, making
  for a powerfully lightning projectile. The Artisan must work on the packet for a
  Focus Quick 100 and may then throw it at any time. If the spell-ball leaves their
  hand or touches any object other than their hand, it will discharge. Deposit the
  Forgesource in the Ashbin after the battle.
