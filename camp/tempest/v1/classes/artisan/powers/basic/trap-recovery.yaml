description: >
  The Artisan can spend a Quick 100 gathering the pieces of a trap that they put down themself
  which has since gone off. This will allow a Tinker to remake the trap without any additional
  expenditure of resources. Alternatively, the Artisan can turn in the pieces to Staff to
  convert them into all the resources that were required to make the trap, minus one (i.e. the
  Artisan must choose one resource used to make the trap and sacrifice it). At 10 Artisan
  class-levels they can salvage any trap into its component resources in the above listed
  manner.
