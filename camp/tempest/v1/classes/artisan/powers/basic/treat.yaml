  This Power can only be used out of combat. By expending three Bloom, the Artisan can provide a
  powerful curative brew for up to six other Individuals, moving from one to the other giving
  each a sip which will heal small wounds and injuries. No one target can be given more than
  one sip. The Artisan must Focus for at least 10 seconds over each character to be Treated.

  earliest opportunity.
