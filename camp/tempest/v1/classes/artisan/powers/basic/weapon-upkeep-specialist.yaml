description: |
  The Artisan can alter the creation of a Sharpening Stone they are crafting. If this process is used, the resulting creation is called a "Perfect Sharpening Stone" with an expiration of 1 year. This one-use item provides a +1 bonus to Spike Damage until the user completes a Short Rest. On Thrown and Projectile weapons, the bonus is only on those specific weapons, and the weapons must be distinguishable in some way from the others. The item-cards must be updated with these special features.
