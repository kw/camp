description: |
  The Artisan can alter the creation of a Sharpening Stone they are crafting. If this process
  is used, the resulting creation is called a "Specialist Sharpening Stone" with an expiration
  of 1 year. This item, once per Long Rest, is not consumed on use when the Artisan personally
  uses it and provides +2 to Spike Damage rather than the normal amount. If any other person
  uses the item it is consumed as normal. If this Power is lost or removed, the Specialist
  Sharpening Stone will only function as a standard Sharpening Stone. The Specialist Sharpening
  Stone requires significant dedication to keep up and thus an Artisan may only maintain one at
  a time.

  The itemâ€™s card must be updated with these special features.
