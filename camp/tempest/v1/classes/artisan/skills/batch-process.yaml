  Artisans, being masters of their trade, craft some plans so often that the patterns have
  become mere muscle memory, and are so rote that it becomes trivial to build several copies
  in parallel. Choose one Craft: Alchemy, Arcane Ritual Magic, Divine Ritual Magic, Enchanting,
  or Tinkering. While producing their chosen craft, the Artisan may call “Batch Process” at the beginning of their crafting attempt to double the number of outputs from the crafting plan.
  This requires that the Artisan expend double the appropriate resources for the plan they are crafting.

  **Note**: The crafting process that requires a Dark Territory card pull, a card must be
  pulled twice. The first card must be resolved before the second card is pulled, and both cards should be pulled from the same hand.
