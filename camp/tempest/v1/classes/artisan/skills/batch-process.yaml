  Masters of their trade, Artisans craft some Plans so often that the patterns have become rote muscle memory, making it trivial to build several copies in parallel.

  Choose one Craft: Alchemy, Arcane Ritual Magic, Divine Ritual Magic, Enchanting, or Tinkering. The Artisan may call “Batch Process” at the beginning of their crafting attempt to double the number of outputs from the crafting plan. This requires that the Artisan expend double the appropriate resources for the plan they are crafting.

  Note: Crafting processes requiring a Dark Territory card pull must be pulled twice from the same hand. Resolve the first card before the second is pulled.
