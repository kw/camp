  The Artisan has found shortcuts and efficiencies in Plans after many hours spent honing and perfecting their craft.

  Choose one Craft: Alchemy, Enchanting, or Tinkering. The Artisan may reduce all mentions of “turns of the hourglass” by half, and single turns of the hourglass are reduced to a Quick Count of 30. All other repeated actions are reduced by half (rounded up). This power may be purchased once for each Craft.

  **Note**: This Power stacks with other time reduction skills for crafting, however, the reductions from this Power are calculated first.
