description: |
  The Artisan gains the Apprentice Arcane Ritual Magic or Apprentice Divine Ritual
  Magic skill.

  For the purposes of Rituals, the Adept Ritualist counts as two Participants. For
  Rituals that give greater benefits for higher numbers of Ritualists (rather than
  those that need more than one Ritualist to perform all the functions), the Artisan
  also counts as two Ritualists (Primary & Secondary, or Secondary x2) once they
  reach 7th level Artisan.

  Once they reach 3rd level Artisan, once per Long Rest, they may choose any one
  Basic Resource (Bloom, Hide, Ingots, or Coin) required for a Ritual and proceed
  with one less of that Resource, to a minimum of 1.

  **Note**: if the Resource has some part of the Ritual to perform, a stand-in item
  must be used (such as rocks for Ingots, for example).
