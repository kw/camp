  The Artisan gains the Apprentice Enchanting (3) skill.
  <br/>
  The Artisan often wishes to harness the powers of the cosmos itself, but sometimes
  has a difficult time acquiring a spellbook from an Arcane or Divine caster to make scrolls.
  <br/>
  The Artisan may create their own "crafter's spellbook" that has any number of spells
  in it, both Arcane and Divine. To add a spell to the "crafter's spellbook" The Artisan
  must copy the spell from a caster's spellbook using 1 Simple Ink and 1 Hide into the
  "crafter's spellbook" both in English and the incant in the Primal Script. Once the
  spell has been copied into the "crafter's spellbook" it may be copied into other
  crafter's spellbooks using the same process, but never into a caster's spellbook. Please
  deposit the Simple Ink and Hide into the Ashbin after a spell has been copied.
  <br/>
  This "crafter's spellbook" must remain in the Planar Weir or it loses all powers and
  properties while it is not present in the Weir. As long as it is there Enchanters
  (including Enchanters that are not the Artisan that crafted it) may create scrolls using
  the normal process as if they had a spellcaster's book with the appropriate spell in it.
  This spellbook has no other properties, including to cast spells out of it with a
  bookcaster or to memorize spells from it.
  <br/>
  Only Novice and Adept spells from Base Classes may be copied into a “crafter's
  spellbook,” never spells from Advanced Class spell lists or Greater or Master spells.
