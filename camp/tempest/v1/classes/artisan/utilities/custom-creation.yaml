description: >
  This Power has two uses, which can be used at the same time, or separately. The Artisan
  can alter the structure of any item they have Crafted that has an associated item card
  and requires Attunement. Spending a few seconds focusing on the item, they can add a
  requirement to the Attunement of any kind they desire. This might be “Can only be
  Attuned to Tristan Mageborn” or it might be something more generic such as “Can only be
  Attuned to a worshiper of Evandra”. The requirement is only relevant in order to Attune
  to the item; Attunement is not lost if the Attuned owner loses that requirement later
  (such as converting to a different god).
  <br/>
  The Power can also be used to add a specific limitation to an item that requires
  Attunement and has an information card. This limitation might be “Can only be activated
  by Humans” or “To activate the item, the character must yell ‘I love Evandra!’” The
  limitation is up to the Crafter. Limitations that require abusive behavior or
  non-consensual behavior immediately fail.
  <br/>
  For either use of this Power, the item’s card must be updated with the information.
