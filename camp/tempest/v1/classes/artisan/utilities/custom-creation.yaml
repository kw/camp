  **Skills and Options**: The Artisan gains the Apprentice Enchanting (3) skill.

  This Power has two uses which may be used separately or simultaneously. The Artisan spends a few seconds focusing on the item to alter its structure, allowing them to add or alter Attunement requirements.

  **Item Requirements**:

  - Crafted by the Artisan
  - Has a card
  - Requires Attunement

  ### <u>Power Use #1 - Add Attunement</u>

  After focusing, the Artisan may add any kind of Attunement requirement. Examples include something as specific as “Can only be Attuned to Tristan Mageborn” and as generic as “Can only be Attuned to a worshiper of The Tower”. Attunement is not lost if the required trait changes (such as converting to a different god).

  ### <u>Power Use #2 - Add Limitation</u>

  After focusing, the Artisan may add a specific limitation to an item’s activation and use. This limitation might be “Can only be activated by Humans” or “To activate the item, the character must yell ‘I love soup!’” Limitations requiring abusive or non-consensual behavior immediately fail.

  For either use of this Power, the item’s card must be updated with the information.
