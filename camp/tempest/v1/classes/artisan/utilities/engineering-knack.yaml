description: >
  The Artisan is a natural at constructing large objects. Any time a Tinkering, Alchemy,
  or Enchanting project requires a Forgesource as one of its materials the Artisan may
  spend 1 less (minimum of 1). Additionally, the Artisan counts as 2 Tinkers or 2
  Alchemists or 2 Enchanters when determining how many individuals are working on the
  project requiring Forgesources. The Artisan may only count as an Apprentice if they do
  not normally have the skills for that category, otherwise they count for twice the
  skills they have.
  <br/>
  **For Example**: Trisha the Artisan with Engineering Knack and Journeyman Tinkering is
  working with members of their town to construct a well. The well requires 2 Journeyman
  Tinkers, 2 Apprentice Alchemists, and 1 Journeyman Enchanter. Trisha could satisfy
  either the requirement for both the Journeyman Tinkers or both the Apprentice Alchemists
  even though Trisha is not an Apprentice Alchemist. Trisha would also reduce the number
  of Forgesources required to build the well by 1. Trisha could not help with the need for
  a Journeyman Enchanter.
