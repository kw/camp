  The Artisan gains the skill Apprentice Tinkering (3).
  <br/>
  The Artisan knows the power of creation itself: the power of Forgesources.
  An Artisan with this power may craft two Forgesources at the same time.
  <br/>
  Additionally, the Artisan may make Forgesources when they are only an Apprentice
  Tinker rather than the normal requirement of being a Journeyman Tinker.
  <br/>
  Finally, the Artisan may replace any Uncommon resource (Rare Minerals, Harvest,
  Night Prizes) in a Tinkering Schematic with a Forgesource at-will.
