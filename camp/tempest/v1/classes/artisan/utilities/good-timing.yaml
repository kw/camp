  The Artisan gains their next rank of Prospecting ignoring any Level prerequisites,
  if this would put the character over three ranks, they are instead refunded a rank.

  Additionally, the Artisan may skip Prospecting during the first Long Rest period and
  instead Prospect twice the next Long Rest period per Mine/Rare Mineral Spring.

  ### CMA Notes

  Only Prospect I will be granted, but the character will receive the appropriate refund
  if it is already known so that you can buy Prospect II or Prospect III instead. If you
  have this power, the level requirement for Prospect III is waived.
