  The Artisan gains Forage I, refunding as necessary. Additionally, you may take Forage III before reaching 10th level.

  The Artisan is used to walking the land looking for Bloom and Night Prizes. Hunter Gatherers may take 1 additional Night Prize from a "mushroom patch" for every rank of Foraging they possess. This does not increase the total number of Night Prizes they may collect per Event overall, just from any particular patch.
