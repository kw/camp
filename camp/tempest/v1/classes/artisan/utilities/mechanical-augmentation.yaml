  The Artisan can mechanically augment themselves, becoming a powered construct. They must have a Forgesource that is not being used for other things with them the entire time the Power is activated. While Augmented the Artisan have the Construct and Automaton Qualifiers (Not Types).

  In addition, when using a Power that targets themselves, Mechanically Augmented Artisans may use a Spike in lieu of a Forgesource once per Power. The Artisan is inherently slowed as their body is infused with mechanical features. The Artisan may spend 4 points of Living Iron to Counter Poison, Agony, and Fear Accents.
