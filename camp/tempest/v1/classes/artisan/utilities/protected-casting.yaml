  The Artisan can protect a ritual from disturbance with a small rite of consecration. First, the Artisan lays down a white rope or cord that is no longer than 100 feet long that has been laid down to make a continuous shape (usually a circle). Then the Artisan walks the perimeter of the rope, chanting and speaking words of mystic significance. During this time, the Artisan should also explain to the others who will take part in the Ritual how the Weapon and Materia resistance works (see below). This should take at least 30 seconds.

  Anyone not there for the explanation, will not get the benefit. At the completion of this invocation, the caster should touch the completed circle, and declare the casting complete, at which point the lain rope cannot be purposefully moved by anyone other than the caster, and anyone who attempts to do so should be informed by use of “Instruction: You may not move the rope.” or similar. This does not prevent people from crossing the threshold of the cord, rope, or the like.

  Should the rope be moved purposefully by the caster, the Power ends. This should be communicated to others trying to touch or manipulate it. The circle can be Dispelled by Dispel Magic and similar magic. The circle’s power ends as soon as a ritual completes inside it, or when moved by the caster, whichever comes first.

  While inside the cord and engaged in a Ritual casting, all Ritualists and Participants actively involved in a Ritual have resistance to Weapons and Materia from sources not involved with the ritual and taking damage from Weapons and Materia will not disrupt the Ritual.
