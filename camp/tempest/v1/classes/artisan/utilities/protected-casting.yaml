  When casting a ritual, the Artisan is shrouded by a magic circle.
  The circle is only big enough to encompass the Artisan themself,
  to a maximum size of 3 feet in diameter. The circle dissipates
  immediately when the ritual ends. Once the circle is up, the
  Artisan gains a number of Counters vs Weapons equal to their
  Artisan class-level. These protections will prevent disruption of
  the ritual by weapon delivered damage and effects - the Artisan
  need only say “Counter, Protected Casting” when struck to
  acknowledge the attack, but the ritual remains undisrupted.
  <br/>
  These defenses are lost when the circle dissipates. The Artisan
  is responsible for providing the physical representation of this,
  otherwise the circle does not form.
