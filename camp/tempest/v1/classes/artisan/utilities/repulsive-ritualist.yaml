  While the Artisan is a ritualist actively engaged in a ritual, they
  can Repel other creatures who come near. The Artisan may use this
  Power without disrupting the ritual they are working on, even if
  the Ritual would normally be disrupted by the Ritualist using Powers.
  The Artisan may use the call for this power a number of times equal
  to the character’s Artisan class-levels.

  **Note**: the use of this Power may not be enough to stop them from
  disrupting a Ritual.
