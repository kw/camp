  The Artisan gains Scavenging I, refunding as necessary. Additionally, you may take Scavenging III before reaching 10th level.

  The Artisan knows their way around a knife and hide. Tanners may instantly Scavenge a creature not already being Scavenged by another. The Artisan may call "Counter, Tanner" to any damage received while waiting for their token.

  **Note**: This Power ends once they receive their token, or if they take any actions other than waiting to receive their loot. The Counter does not prevent any damage taken from the Scavenging itself. The Counter does not stop Effects.
