name: Tanner
tags: [crafter]
grants: scavenging-1
description: |
  The Artisan gains their next rank of Scavenging (3) ignoring any Level prerequisites,
  if this would put the character over three ranks, they are instead refunded a rank.

  The Artisan knows their way around a knife and hides. When using the scavenge skill,
  on a creature not currently being scavenged, the Artisan may instantly scavenge a
  creature and it only takes as much time as the portrayer needs to gather the scavenge,
  harvest, and scale for the Artisan to receive it. While the Artisan is waiting for the
  scavenged creature to provide its loot the Artisan may call "Counter, Tanner" to any
  damage received.

  **Note**: this counter may only be called after the scavenging is complete and the
  Artisan is waiting for the portrayer to provide the loot, not going to or coming from
  the body. If the Artisan takes any actions other than waiting to receive the materials
  from the portrayer this power immediately ends. This counter may not be called on damage
  received from the act of scavenging itself.

  Additionally, the Artisan may substitute 1 Bloom for 1 Hide in any crafting that requires
  more than a single Hide once per Long Rest. This represents the Tanner using stretching
  and curing techniques to get more out of less with their Hide.

  ### CMA Notes

  Only Prospect I will be granted, but the character will receive the appropriate refund
  if it is already known so that you can buy Prospect II or Prospect III instead. If you
  have this power, the level requirement for Prospect III is waived.
