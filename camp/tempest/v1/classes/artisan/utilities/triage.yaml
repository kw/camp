  The Artisan gains the Basic Medicine and Diagnose Skills.

  The Artisan has seen their fair share of combat and served as a healer. Quickly diagnosing what is wrong and how to best handle the situation has become second nature.

  The Artisan has more questions they may ask when using Diagnose, honing their perception to uncover personality secrets based on physical observations. The wording need not be exact but the question must stay true to the spirit:

  - Are you currently in a heightened state of emotion/stress?
  - Are you under the effects of mind-altering substances?
  - Have you been in Spirit Form in the last 12 hours?
  - Have you ever had your memory altered?
  - Are you possessed or controlled?
  - What is your profession/class?
