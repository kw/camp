description: |
  The Artisan has seen their fair share of combat and served as a healer in those situations.
  They have learned to quickly see what is wrong and how to best handle the situation.
  They gain the Diagnose and Combat Medic Skills.

  When using the Diagnose skill, the number of questions available to the Artisan are
  increased. They can even tell some things about the personality of those they diagnose
  based on their physical condition. The Artisan may, with Diagnose, ask any of the
  following questions. The wording need not be exact but the question must stay true to
  the spirit:

  * Are you currently in a heightened state of emotion/stress?
  * Are you under the effects of mind-altering substances?
  * Have you been in Spirit Form in the last 12 hours?
  * Have you ever had your memory altered?
  * Are you possessed or controlled?
  * What is your profession/class?
