description:
  The character can write down one Artisan Power with a Refresh of Short Rest or Immediate that she does not have into a special Manual and can use that Power directly from the book. Only Powers of a Tier the character has access to can be recorded and used in this way.
  To use an Artisan Power from the Manual, the character must study it for a full minute before reading the Call directly from the book (if there is one). A Manual-provided Power may only be used out of combat. All other requirements and components will remain the same.
