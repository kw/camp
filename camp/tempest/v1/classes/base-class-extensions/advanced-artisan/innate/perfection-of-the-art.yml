description: |
  Artificers gain +2 Maximum Armor points whenever they are wearing at least one point of Physical Armor. They can Counter one damaging attack made against them
  by calling “Counter, Perfect Art!” This Counter Refreshes upon completing a Short Rest and expending a Forgesource, or automatically without expending a
  Forgesource after completing a Long Rest.

  While the Artisan is a Primary Ritualist, the Artisan may Sacrifice a Maximum Life Point (until the end of the Event) to redraw a card from the
  Final Hand of a Dark Territory pull before the effect of the first card is announced.

  Crafters may gain an extra of each other following resources once per Long Rest, when they would otherwise receive these resources from
  gathering skills: Ingot, Rare Mineral, Hide, Harvest, Bloom, or Night Prize. Additionally, they become immune to hazards from Mining and Scavenging.
  Finally, once per Long Rest they may redraw from the Enchanting Weir if they do not like their results.
