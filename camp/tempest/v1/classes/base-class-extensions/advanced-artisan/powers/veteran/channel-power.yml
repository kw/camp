description: |
  The Artisan calls upon a source of power meaningful to them to empower an individual’s magic reserves. This process can
  be as long or as short as the Artisan desires, but should have meaning to them and be visible and obvious to others. This
  process immediately refreshes a Novice of Adept spell slot (Artisan’s choice) in another individual. If the Artisan is a
  Mystic, this may also return a Greater spell slot.

  The Artisan may instantly Refresh this power if they are the Ritualist of any Ritual where the Blood Price is paid.
