description:
  The Artisan can spend a Quick Count of 100 Focusing on a Forgesource and getting it to overload. Any time after the Incantation
  is complete, before the Artisan completes a Short Rest, the Artisan can discharge the Forgesource to do Lightning damage to a
  target. This destroys the Forgesource. If the Artisan is a Artificer specialist they may instead charge two such Forgesources in
  this manner per use of the Power, but must do a Focus Quick 30 count between uses of them.
