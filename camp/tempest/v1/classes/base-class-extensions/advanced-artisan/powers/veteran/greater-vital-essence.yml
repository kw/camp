description: |
  At the Alchemy station, the Artisan (who must have at least Apprentice Alchemy Skill) can make a potion that allows someone who has
  used a Life-granting Spell to cast it an additional time, contrary to the restriction on many of those Powers. The potion must have
  a card with an Expiration Date of the day after the Event in which it was brewed. The description should make it clear that when
  this potion is imbibed, the drinker can use a Life-giving Power that they have previously used, even if the description of that
  Power says it can only be used once per Long Rest.

  To create this potion, the Artisan can make up their own procedure, which should take at least one minute to perform, and will need
  to expend 10 Bloom, 1 Eternal Blossom, one Foundation Resource Infusion - Spark, and a Forgesource. A Crafter specialization Artisan,
  may spend an additional Eternal Blossom to immediately refresh this Power. This potion is called a “Greater Vital Essence”.
