description:
  This unfortunately-named rite was once used to infuse adventurers with the essence of monsters in order to awaken and enliven their
  senses. The magic has been refined over the centuries so that the monster essences are no longer required, but the name remains. The
  Artisan must Focus for a Quick Count of 100 while working on the energy centers of another Individual, adjusting them, and moving
  them about. At the end of the Focus, the Artisan can restore the energy of the target, granting the benefits (and drawbacks) of an
  instantaneous Short Rest. If the Artisan is a Mystic Specialist, they may apply this to an additional target.
