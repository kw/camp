duration: Short Rest
refresh: Long Rest
effect: Grant Life
description: |
  The Artisan spends a minute or more out-of-combat in meditation and prayer, sometimes chanting arcane words, sometimes invoking
  the Divinities. The next time the Artisan dies, as long as it occurs before the Artisan completes a Short Rest, the Artisan gets
  an immediate “Grant Life” as the Spirits/Divine come to save the character.


  If the Artisan has a Devotion the accent of this power will match their Devotion’s accent (see Religions), if they are Undevoted
  it will be unaccented.  If the Artisan is a Mystic Specialist then they also may choose to become Insubstantial for a slow 30
  count after returning to life.
