description:
  The Artisan can perform a ceremony which can be as long or short, simple or involved, as the Artisan desires. This rite opens up
  the Spirit of the target (which can be the Artisan themself) and allows that character to have one additional Attunement Slot until
  they complete a Long Rest. The Artisan cannot knowingly perform this rite on someone they believe has the Open Spirit rite active on them.
