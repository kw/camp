  The Artisan knows a number of shortcuts and workarounds, so, with extreme focus, diligence, and hard work, they can complete any Apprentice or
  Journeyman Tinkering, Enchantment, or Alchemy crafting that they have the Skill to do (i.e. a Journeyman Tinker cannot perform an Alchemy
  crafting) by spending a Quick Count of 100 in deep Focus, working in strange ways with different tools.

  The Artisan need not be at the proper Crafting Station but does need to work at a Station. They should make up their own “short-cut” procedure.
  The work will still consume all the normal Resources, and have all the normal consequences (Pollution, Life Point loss, etc.). If the recipe
  being performed was Ingot Plate, Bloom Powder, Hide Sheet, Night Prize Essence, Harvest Dust, or Rare Mineral Powder, this Power immediately Refreshes.
