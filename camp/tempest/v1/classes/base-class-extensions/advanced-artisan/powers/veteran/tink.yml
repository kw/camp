description:
  The Artisan can spend a Quick Count of 30 adjusting and repairing the armor, making it fit better and protect better than it has
  any right to. The Artisan will fully repair the armor, which must be physical and, if the Artisan has the Artificer specialization,
  also grant the wearer five points of Barrier.
