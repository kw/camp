  Clerics are the backbone of a team of adventurers. They give strong support with their enchantment magic and keep the team alive with their healing skill. They have some small offensive ability as well. These characters come in many forms, from the dark Clerics that revel in the power that the path of evil has given them, to those who follow the path of pacifism and light. Regardless, the Clerics are a powerful addition to any force.

  The Clerics of history have varied wildly from the priests of early Christian orders to modern ultra-scientific surgeons. Florence Nightingale was a powerful Cleric of her time and was a true worshiper of the power of good. There are other, more magical traditions of healing, though, from those that worship the earth, to those who believe in faith healing and inner wellness.

  The fantastic Cleric comes from a tradition of god-worshiping magic-users whose abilities, granted by their gods, could heal the hurt and even raise the dead. The Clerics of Geas are just like this. They can gain their powers from deities, powers or aspects of any kind. Every Cleric should come up with a greater power that they give fealty and worship to, and from whom they are granted favors and power. Geas Clerics are a truly formidable force and make a powerful addition to any quest.

  Clerics are usually found in either simple priest's robes or in shining battle armor. They can be found in an infinite variety of garb.

  The Cleric is a Divine spell-caster. The Cleric should choose a special symbol that is their caster-sigil and mark their spellbook and packets with it.
