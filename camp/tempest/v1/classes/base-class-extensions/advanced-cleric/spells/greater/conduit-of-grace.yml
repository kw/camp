description: |
  Becoming a conduit of grace allows the Cleric a number of specific abilities until they complete a Long Rest. These are:

  * The Cleric can Cure one Condition by expending 5 points from their Healing Touch pool. This is a Touch-Delivery with the Call of “Cure [Condition] by Radiance”.
  * The Cleric can charge a Spell-Packet to do “3 Radiance” by expending 1 point from their Healing Touch Pool. Each Spell-Packet is charged with the Incantation “Conduit of Grace”.
  * The Cleric can substitute “Faithcast [Spell or Cantrip Name]” for the Incantation of any Cleric Spell or Cleric Cantrip with a standard Incantation. Doing so costs 2 points from the Cleric’s Healing Touch pool.
