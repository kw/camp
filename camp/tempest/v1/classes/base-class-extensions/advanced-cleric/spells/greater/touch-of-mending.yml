description:
  Until the Cleric completes a Long Rest, they may use points from their Divine Pool to Mend Armor instead of Heal.
  The Incantation for Healing Touch remains the same. The Cleric expends double the amount of Pool per point of Mending
  granted to the target. The same limits apply to Mending as did to Healing.
