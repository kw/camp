description: |
  The Druid may protect themself from harm by drawing a camouflaging cloak about them and melding with the forest. They are empowered to seek shelter
  within the wood of a tree, becoming insubstantial to the real world so long as they do not move.

  After spending two Spikes, the Druid must gather their naturally-colored hooded cloak around them, Focus for a Quick Count of 30, and call out "Grant
  Insubstantial to" They will retain the insubstantial Condition until they choose to move, are knocked out of Insubstantial form by an Effect, or Dusk comes.

  Once the spell is ended, by whatever means, they must Cure their Insubstantial Condition by calling "Cure Insubstantial." Remember that when insubstantial,
  the player has a duty to inform anyone that inspects, closely interacts with, or plans to attack the character.
