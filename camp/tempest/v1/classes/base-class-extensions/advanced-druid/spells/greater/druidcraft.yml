description: |
  The Druid takes on the power of the forest around them, gaining a host of abilities and powers. These are as follows:

    * Animal Lore: The Druid is treated as having Lore: Nature, Tracking, and may use “[Name or Description] Discern by Mind: Are you an [Animal/Beast]?” at-will.
    * Animal Speech: The Druid may use “Instruction to Animal or Beast: You can understand my words.”
    * Friend of Plants: The Druid can do “Heal 1 to Plant” as a Touch Power with an Incantation of Focus Quick 30. They can also “Cure [Condition] to Plant”, but this refreshes only after a Short Rest.
    * Friend of the Shrubs: The Druid need not use a tool to remove Bloom, nor take any time to do it. The Druid need only ask the plant to give them the Bloom or give the Bloom itself a small compliment before taking Bloom.
    * Lifecast: As long as the Druid is touching a living plant or creature (plants that are cut within the same Event are still alive), the Druid may pay 2 points from their Lifetap pool and substitute “By stone, by flame, by wind and rain, I call for [Name of Spell]” for all standard Druid Incantations.
