description: |
  The Druid channels the fury of nature and can charge a Spell-Ball or Weapon with a barely contained storm. The Druid can choose from one of the following Accents: Flame, Acid, Lighting, Ice, Poison, or Disease and charge the Spell-Ball or Weapon to do “Wounding 15 by [Accent]” to whatever it strikes. If that attack misses or is Prevented, the Druid can call out “I reclaim my fury!” to charge a second attack with “Wounding 8 by [Accent]”. The second attack need not have the same Accent or Delivery (Materia or Weapon) as the first.
