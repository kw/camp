  While they may not have the Perfect Defense of a more standard Fighter, those that specialize with a Projectile weapon have some tricks that are powerful as well. A Fighter who takes this Power may refresh all Fighter Base Class Powers that have the words “Projectile” or “Thrown” in them once per Long Rest.

  If this Power is purchased the Fighter loses their Perfect Defense Innate Power.
# TODO: Unsure how to make the purchase of one skill remove an innate power.
