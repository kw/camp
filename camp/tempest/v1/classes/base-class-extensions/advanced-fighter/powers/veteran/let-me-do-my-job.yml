description:
  The Fighter can Counter one Effect used against them. Once the Fighter has Countered that Effect, they can Refresh this Power at-will by Focusing for a Quick Count of 30, but can only use it against that same Effect. Once the character has completed a Short Rest, the Power can no longer be Refreshed until the Fighter completes a Long Rest.
