name: Galvanicus' Lance
incant: Standard
call: “Wounding 10 by Lightning”
target: Individual
duration: Instantaneous
delivery: Spell-Ball
refresh: Spell
accent: Arcane / Lightning
effect: Wounding, Refresh
description: |
  This Spell charges two Spell-Balls of immense power. Each one does Wounding 10 by Lightning. If both bolts strike the same target, and are not prevented, the spell immediately refreshes. This Refresh effect may only occur once per Event.

  Enhancement: [Patron Galvanicus] Expend a Spike: The Mage may instead utter a quick prayer (Q30) to Galvanicus, replacing the normal incant, to call down one strike summoned from the heavens
  above. The delivery instead becomes “Verbal,” making the Call “[Name or Description] 25 Lightning.”  If this call is prevented, the Mage may immediately charge two Spell-Balls as above.
