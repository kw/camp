description:
  The Rogue can only use this ability after moving off to a location removed from combat. They then go insubstantial and can return to the battle and may collect their personally owned projectile ammunition, thrown weapons, spell-packets, or spell-balls. Any time after they have collected at least one, they can Cure their insubstantial Condition by calling "Cure Insubstantial."
