  The Socialite may put a request into Staff for a specific Resource, which can be any kind including a “Named” Resource (such as Last Breath, Mote of Power, or Basilisk’s Lies). Staff will always provide a cost for that thing and the Socialite may pay that stated cost any time before the end of the Event.

  Note that Resources that are gating certain Plot-controlled things or that are above the power-level of the Socialite may be given impossible costs. Some negotiation with Staff concerning reasonable requests is allowed (i.e. “Is a Medusa’s Heart a Resource I have any hope of affording?”). This cannot be used in conjunction with Contractual Subsidy.
