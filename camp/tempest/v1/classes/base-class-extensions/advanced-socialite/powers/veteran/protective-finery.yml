description: |
  The Socialite has a way of using the frills, under-vests, petticoats, and other folds and filigree of fine cloths as protection against blows. As long as the garb the
  Socialite is wearing is, in the opinion of the Socialite, well-maintained and stylish or flattering, it counts as 2 points of Physical Armor. If the garb is, in the
  opinion of the Socialite, particularly special, fine, or comely, it counts as 4. And if the Socialite believes themself well “dressed to the nines”, it counts as 6
  points of Physical Armor.

  If the finery being worn is also armor, the Socialite must choose whether to take normal Armor evaluation, or the evaluation from Protective Finery. Other Powers that
  require the character to be wearing Physical Armor treat Protective Finery as normal armor.
