accent: Eldritch Accent
effect: Wounding, Grant Barrier
description: |
  The Sourcerer charges three Spell-Balls with significant power. After the final Spell-Ball is used, the Sourcerer adds 2 Barrier per Spell-Ball that had its effects Prevented. Normally this could add up to 6 Barrier, but other Powers that increase the number of Spell-Balls charged will also increase the amount of Barrier available.

  Note: As all of this barrier is coming from this spell, it counts as a single source, as therefore is not subject to stacking limitations.

  Enhancement: If the Sourcerer’s [Eldritch Accent] is Ice the Sourcerer instead adds 4 Barrier per Spell-Ball that had its effects Prevented.
