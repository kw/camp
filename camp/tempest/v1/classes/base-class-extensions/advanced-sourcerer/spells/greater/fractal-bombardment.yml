description: |
  The Sourcerer creates a tear in reality through which pure power can flow through at increasing rates.

  The Sourcerer may initially charge a Spell-Ball with "1 [Eldritch Accent]" and attack a target with it.

  If the attack does not Miss and is not Prevented, the caster may immediately charge another Spell-Ball, and the damage of the Call increases by one, repeating for each attack. The cap for the Damage these Spell-Balls may do is equal to the Sourcerer’s Base Spike Damage Bonus plus one.

  The Sourcerer may continue to charge Spell-Balls until the Sourcerer casts any other spell, completes a Short Rest, the caster becomes unable to use Powers, a Spell-Ball Misses, or three Spell-Balls are Prevented, at which time any charged Spell-Ball loses its power, and Fractal Bombardment ends.
