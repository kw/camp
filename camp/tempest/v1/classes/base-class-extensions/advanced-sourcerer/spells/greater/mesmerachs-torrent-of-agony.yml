  Upon completion of the Incantation, the Sourcerer gains the power to throw an infinite number of damaging Spell-Balls as long as they do not move their right foot from its spot. As long as their right foot remains planted, the Sourcerer can instantly charge any Spell-Ball they hold in their hand.

  Twice during the Duration of the Spell, the caster can move their right foot, leaving the spot and choosing another spot. While moving, the caster loses access to the infinite spell-ball charging. Once they have re-planted their right foot, they may continue charging and throwing.

  This Spell ends when the caster un-plants their right foot a third time, or completes a Short Rest.
