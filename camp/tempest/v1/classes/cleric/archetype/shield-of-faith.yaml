description: |
  The Cleric's faith protects them from those that seek to do them harm, forming a magical shield around any shield the Cleric wields in battle.

  The Cleric may call “Counter, Shield” when the shield is hit by any attack with Weapon or Packet delivery - this negates the attack. Attacks that do not strike the Cleric's shield may not be countered in this way. This power refreshes every Short Rest.
