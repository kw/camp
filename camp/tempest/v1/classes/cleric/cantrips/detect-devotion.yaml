description: |
  This divination spell will let the Cleric know if a particular creature is a believer of a specific religion or deity, depending on how the spell is cast. The spell may not always result in information, due to the frenetic nature of combat. This spell may be cast upon a living, unconscious, or dead creature, or a spirit.
