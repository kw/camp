description: |
  This divination cantrip will let the Cleric know if a particular creature is Undead, an Angel, or a Demon.
  Only one of the options can be detected by any single casting of the spell. The spell may not always result
  in information, due to the frenetic nature of combat. Each question (Undead/Angel/Demon) may only be asked
  once of any given target.
