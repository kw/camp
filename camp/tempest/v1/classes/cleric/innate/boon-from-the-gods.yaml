description: |
  After having an extended conversation with a mortal representative of their Devotion (such as a
  Divine Hand, Divine Shield, Exemplar, Inquisitor, or future roles or classes with the [Religious]
  tag), the Cleric may be granted the blessing of that representative and receive the grace of their
  shared divine faith.

  The granting representative has the sole discretion to decide if the Cleric has earned their
  favor in this way.
  Should the representative decide the Cleric is worthy, they may use any unexhausted Power they
  have normally with a target of Self or Individual on the Cleric and immediately refresh the power
  as though they hadnâ€™t used it. In all other ways, the power works normally on the Cleric.

  This power should be explained to the representative including the ability to not grant the blessing.

  In addition, this Power can be used with a supernatural Entity such as an Angel, Demon, or even the Deity
  of their Devotion. In this particular circumstance the Entity might use the connection to confer a measure
  of divine power, should they deem the Cleric worthy and their situation commensurate.

  Simple prayer generally is not enough to ask for such a Boon through this power, and the Entity must be
  present with the Cleric: often the Commune Divine Ritual is used for this purpose.

  Note: One common boon requested of Entities is to Refresh all Novice, Adept, and Greater spell slots spent
  previously. This is generally granted as long as the Cleric has been performing their duties with rigor and
  following the Tenets of their Devotion faithfully.

  However, what is granted is up to the Entities discretion and may vary greatly, as are the consequences of
  being found unworthy or the presumption of the request. Asking powerful Entities for boons is not without risk,
  especially Entities known to be fickle or exacting.
