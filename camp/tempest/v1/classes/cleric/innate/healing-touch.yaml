description: |
  The cleric gains a pool of healing that can be used between Long Rests called the Healing
  Touch Pool. This Healing Touch pool is equal to three times the Cleric’s class-level.

  Each time this power is used, the Cleric can heal another Individual up to the Cleric’s
  class-level, subtracting the healing from the Healing Touch Pool. Healing Touch will not
  work on the caster themself.

  **For Example**: a 4th level Cleric would have 12 total points of Healing to give out
  between Long Rests and could use this Power to Heal up to 4 points at a time. There is
  no limit to the number of points that can be in this pool; however, the pool resets to
  three times the Cleric’s class-level at the end of a Long Rest.

  **Note**: While this Power is an Innate power, for purposes of Advanced Peacecaster,
  it counts as a Cantrip, bonus healing provided by Advanced Peacecaster is not subtracted
  from the Cleric's Healing Touch pool, however a minimum of 1 point must always
  be subtracted.
