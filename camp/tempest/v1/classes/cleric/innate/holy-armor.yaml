description: |
  The Cleric's deity shows them favor through power infused into the Cleric's summoned armors.
  For every 3 points of summoned armor that the character creates with a Power (including Spells),
  the armor's Maximum increases by one additional point.

  This Bonus does not stack with other sources that add to Summoned Armor and have no effect on
  Natural or Physical Armor.

  For Example: If a Power were used (such as Divine Armor), that would normally Grant 4 Summoned
  Armor to the caster, it would instead Grant 5 Points of Summoned Armor.
