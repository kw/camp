description: |
  The Cleric can pray to their divinity or religion to rebuild focus and refresh their
  Divine Spell-slots. The Cleric can spend a Short Rest studying their spell-book, meditating,
  or speaking to their higher powers.

  The Cleric can perform this special study and refresh all of their expended Divine spell-slots.
  If the Cleric has used any other Innate Power from another class to refresh their Divine
  spell-slots this long rest they may not use Refreshing Prayer.

  Alternatively, if the Cleric prays in an area of sacred faith (such as consecrated ground),
  especially an area sacred to the Clericâ€™s religion or divinity, the Cleric gains three additional
  Novice-tier Spell-Slots (These may exceed the normal maximum slots the Cleric would have).
  These Spell-Slots last until the Cleric completes a Long Rest. Additional benefits may be
  possible (see the Character Options chapter for more details).
