  The caster grants themself 3 Summoned Armor Points. This is considered a new “suit” or armor and is not stackable with other sources of summoned armor. This spell also grants a single Protection from Melee Weapons to the Cleric. The recipient should call out “Protect” to Counter a melee weapon attack. If instead of granting summoned armor the cleric is wearing physical worn armor, this spell instead grants the cleric +2 Maximum Armor.
