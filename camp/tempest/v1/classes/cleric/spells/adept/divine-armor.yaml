  The caster grants themself 4 Summoned Armor Points. This is considered a new “suit” or armor and
  is not stackable with other sources of Summoned Armor.

  If instead of granting Summoned Armor the Cleric is wearing Physical Armor, this Spell instead
  grants the Cleric +2 Maximum Armor.

  Either way, This spell also grants a single Protection from Melee Weapons to the Cleric. The recipient
  should call out “Protect” to Counter a melee weapon attack.
