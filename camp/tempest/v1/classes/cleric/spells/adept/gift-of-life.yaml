description: |
  This powerful spell washes the target in life-energy. If the target is a corpse, it will bring
  it back to the living with 1 Life Point.

  This spell can only be used to bring one corpse back from the dead once per Long Rest. However,
  If a Power refreshes a Long Rest ability, it can target the “once per Long Rest” limitation of this
  spell, allowing one more individual to be brought back to life by this spell.

  If Gift of Life is used on an Undead, it will cause the creature to immediately discorporate
  and take Spirit Form.
