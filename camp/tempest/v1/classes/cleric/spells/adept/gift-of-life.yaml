description: |
  This powerful spell washes the target in life-energy. If the target is a corpse, it will bring it back to the living with 1 Life Point. Grant Life used on an Undead, it will cause the creature to immediately discorporate and take Spirit Form. This spell can only be used to bring one corpse back from the dead once per Long Rest. Casting this spell adds seven points to the Cleric’s Healing Touch pool if they have one. If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead they will add eight points into their Healing Touch pool if they have one. If a power refreshes a Long Rest ability, it can target the “one per Long Rest” limitation of this spell, allowing one more individual to be brought back to life by this spell.
