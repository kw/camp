description: |
  Wrapping their target in iron bands of willpower, the Cleric captures a creature and locks it away.
  While the creature is Imprisoned, the Cleric may charge harming or healing powers to use on that creature.
  After focusing for a Quick 30, the Cleric may either do “[Name or Description] 2 by Radiance to Imprisoned”
  as a verbal, or may do “[Name or Description] Heal 2 by Radiance to Imprisoned” as a verbal. This may be done
  as often as desired until the target ceases to be Imprisoned by this spell.

  Note: If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead the Call becomes “[Name or Description] Heal 3 by Radiance
  to Imprisoned”, and if the caster has the Warcaster skill, instead the Call becomes “[Name or Description] 3 by
  Radiance to Imprisoned.” This is an exception to normal Peacecasting / Warcasting rules
