description: |
  Lightstorm charges spell-balls with a dreadful divine light. As long as the Cleric does not move their right foot, or use another non-Counter Power, they can charge additional spell-balls to do the same thing by using the incantation “I call for the Lightstorm.”

  Each Lightstorm ball thrown at an opponent will add one point to the Cleric’s Healing Touch pool to a maximum of 3 if they have one. Once the Cleric moves their right foot or uses a non-Counter Power, the power flows out of them, the spell ends and they are drained for a Quick Count of 100. At-will, the caster may expend a Spike to charge a single spell-ball with “Wounding 4 by Radiance to Undead” while this spell is active.
