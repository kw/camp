effect: Immunity
description: |
  This spell must be cast while inside a white cord, rope, or the like that is no longer than 10 feet long that has been laid down to make a continuous shape (usually a circle). At the completion of the Incantation, the lain rope cannot be purposefully moved by anyone other than the caster, and anyone who attempts to do so should be informed. This should be communicated to others trying to touch or manipulate it. As long as the Cleric is inside the circle, they have immunity to all Effects and damage coming from outside the circle. If the Cleric steps out, uses Powers or spells on anyone outside the Circle, or does damage to anyone outside the Circle, they must pick up the circle and end the spell. Note this does not prevent people from crossing the threshold of the cord, rope, or the like.
