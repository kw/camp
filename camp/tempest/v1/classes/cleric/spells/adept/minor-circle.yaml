description: |
  This spell must be cast while inside a white cord, rope, or the like that is no longer than 10
  feet long that has been laid down to make a continuous shape (usually a circle). At the completion
  of the Incantation, the lain rope cannot be purposefully moved by anyone other than the caster, and
  anyone who attempts to do so should be informed by use of “Instruction: You may not move the rope.”
  or similar. This does not prevent people from crossing the threshold of the cord, rope, or the like.

  Should the rope be moved purposefully by the caster, the spell ends. This should be communicated to
  others trying to touch or manipulate it. As long as the caster has both feet completely inside the
  circle, they have immunity to all Effects and Damage.

  If the caster uses a Power on anyone who has both feet entirely outside the Circle, causes damage
  to another creature, or if the caster steps out of the Circle, the immunity granted by the Circle
  is removed. In addition, they must pick up the circle and end the Spell. The Circle can be Dispelled
  by Dispel Magic and similar magic.

  Note: The caster may only have one Circle active at any given time, regardless of origin.
