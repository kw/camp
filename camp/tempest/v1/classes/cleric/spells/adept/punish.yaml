  Tapping into the depths of their Devotion, the caster punishes those of other Devotions. The caster
  may add the Qualifier “to [Devotion]” and make the Call “Wounding 8 [to Devotion]”, instead, but the
  Cleric may not include their own Devotion as the Qualifier.

  Enhancement: Greater Spell-Slot: The damage becomes “12 Radiance” and “Wounding 12 to [Devotion]
  by Radiance” instead.
  Enhancement: Master Spell-Slot: The damage becomes “20 Radiance” and “Piercing 10 to [Devotion]
  by Radiance” instead.

  Note: Undevoted is a legal Devotion.
