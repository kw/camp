description: |
  This spell allows the Cleric to protect themself from damage, giving two “Retributive Protection” Counters,
  which Prevent two damaging attacks of any kind. In order to prime the retributive part of this spell, the
  Cleric must point at a creature and say “I call my faith to warn you against harming me.” Only the last
  creature that they warned will be a valid target for retribution.

  When the Cleric uses a Counter defense from this spell to stop damage from the last warned creature, they may
  call out a Verbal Effect against that attacker: “[Name or Description], Piercing 2 by Radiance.” This can be
  done once for each Counter defense that is used. This spell ends early if the Cleric causes harm to another
  with Damage or Effects other than the Damage from this spell.
