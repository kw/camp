description: |
  After completing the incantation, the caster will become Insubstantial. They can then walk
  directly to a nearby area (within 10 minutes walk) which they have previously been to, that
  is consecrated or holy to their Devotion. Alternatively, they can go to an area protected by
  a Haven to which they are connected (as per the Haven Ritual).

  When they arrive and enter they lose their insubstantial Condition and should call “Cure
  Insubstantial.” They should carefully read the Haven information card before entering a Haven,
  as some have special requirements or prohibitions.

  If they are unable to enter the Haven (if it is proofed against insubstantial creatures, for example)
  and have no other viable options (i.e. is only connected to one Haven) they must immediately call
  the “Cure Insubstantial” and end the spell, leaving them outside the Haven. If they are connected
  to multiple Havens, they can choose, walk to, and attempt to enter the next one, until all
  possibilities have been exhausted.
