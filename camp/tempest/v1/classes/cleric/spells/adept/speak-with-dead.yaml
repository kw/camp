  Out of combat, after completing the incantation while within Touch range of a corpse, the Cleric

  The Cleric may ask up to three questions.

  The questions posed must be yes or no questions and the call for each question is “Discern to Corpse
  by Radiance: [Yes/No question]”. Once a corpse has been asked all of the allotted questions, the Cleric
  may not cast this spell on that same corpse again.

  The spell will end immediately if the Cleric leaves Touch range of the corpse, speaks for any reason
  other than to ask more Speak With Dead questions of the corpse, or enters combat.
