description: |
  The spell lets the Cleric determine whether an action they are about to take will be, on the whole, harmful
  or beneficial, to them and their goals. They might, for example, ask if it is boon or bane to walk down the
  apparently empty hallway in front of them. Or they might ask if it is boon or bane to open the chest they are holding.

  If there is no good answer, the answer is unknown, or there are bad assumptions in the question (“Boon or bane
  to trust the emissary of the Korstone Dwarves?” when there is not an emissary of Korstone Dwarves) will all
  give “Unknown” as an answer. If the answer is Unknown, the Spell-Slot used to cast the spell is Refreshed.
