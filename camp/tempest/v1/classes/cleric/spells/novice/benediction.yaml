description: |
  This spell can be cast on a group of people who are within Touch range of the caster and can only be cast out of combat. The Cleric can either Heal each target for 2 Life Points, or Mend the armor of each target for 2 points. The same option must be chosen for all targets. If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead the entire effect is improved, making the call “Heal 3 by Radiance” to all affected targets. If the caster expends a Spike in the casting of this spell, they may call “Mend 3 by Radiance.”
