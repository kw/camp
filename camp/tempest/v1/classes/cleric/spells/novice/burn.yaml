description: |
  The Cleric calls down holy flame to cause another’s equipment to burn. Any hand that is holding an
  item will cause that equipment to be disarmed. The caster should only call out arms that they can
  tell are holding items. If the caster cannot tell whether the hand is empty or not, that arm
  shouldn’t be called.

  Enhancement: Expend a Spike: An additional Spell-Ball is charged.
