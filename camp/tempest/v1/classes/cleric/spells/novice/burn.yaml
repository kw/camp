description: |
  The Cleric calls down holy flame to cause another’s equipment to burn. Any hand that is holding an item will cause that equipment to be disarmed. The caster should only call out arms that they can tell are holding items. If the caster cannot tell whether the hand is empty or not, that arm shouldn’t be called, and is not disarmed. If the caster expends a Spike an additional Spell ball is charged.
