description: |
  After the incantation is successfully completed, the caster gains the power to cross their hands
  in front of their chest once and call “Long Imprison to Self by Force.” to lock themself into a
  prison of power, ideally protecting themselves from harm. At any time after imprisoning themself,
  the Cleric can call “Cure Imprisoned” to drop the Fortress. The ability to put up the Fortress will
  only last until the completion of the next Long Rest once the spell is cast.
