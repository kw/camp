description: |
  After the incantation is successfully completed, the caster gains the power to cross their hands in front of their chest and call “Imprison Self by Force.” to lock themself into a prison of power, ideally protecting themselves from harm. At any time after imprisoning themself, the Cleric can call “Dispel Imprisoned” to drop the Fortress. The ability to put up the Fortress will only last until the completion of the next Long Rest once the spell is cast.
