description: |
  This spell will return the target to life with 1 Life Point if they are 5th level or lower. If the spell
  fails because the target is not fifth level or lower, the spell immediately Refreshes.

  Alternatively, the Spell can be used to bring a character back to life, with 1 Life Point, as long as they
  share the same Devotion as the Cleric.

  Note: The Cleric can only cast the version of this spell that returns an individual that shares their
  Devotion once per Long Rest.
