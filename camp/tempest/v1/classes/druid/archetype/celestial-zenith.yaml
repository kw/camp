description: |
  While in the Form of the Rising Sun, the Druid’s may Focus for a Quick 100
  and expend a Spike to Grant themselves a Protect vs Packets a number of times
  per Long Rest equal to their Maximum Life Points.

  Conversely, while in the Form of the Waning Moon, may convert a Wounding
  Effect to Piercing once per Long Rest.

  Regardless of Form, the Druid gains the Inherent Type: Beast, and is affected
  by all spells, powers, and effects that target those traits.
