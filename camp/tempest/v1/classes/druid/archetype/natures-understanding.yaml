  This power allows the character to determine if a targeted creature is a beast of nature, and its intent.
  The power lasts until the Druid moves their right foot or takes a Short Rest, whichever comes first.
  Until it ends, the Druid can ask any of the following questions as often as desired of any number of
  targets that they can see, but may only ask each target each question once.

  - “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern: Are you an Animal, Beast, or neither?”
  - “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern to [Animal/Beast]: Why are you here?”
  - “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern to [Animal/Beast]: What are you feeling?”
  - “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern to [Animal/Beast]: Do you mean me harm?”
  - “[Name or Description] Subtle Discern to [Animal/Beast]: What kind of [Animal/Beast] are you?”
