description:
  This minor cantrip takes the power out of a Spell-Ball (or multiple Spell-Balls) that
  has already been charged and returns that power to the caster. The Spell-Ball becomes
  inert, and the caster refreshes the spell-slot that was used to charge the Spell-Ball.
  If the spell charges more than one Spell-Ball, all the Spell-Balls must still be
  charged in order to cancel the spell.
