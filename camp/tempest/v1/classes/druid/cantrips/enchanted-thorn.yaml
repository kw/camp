description:
  The Druid is able to create a wooden thorn that can be thrown as a Thrown Weapon.
  The caster can use any Powers or other abilities (like Spikes) on the thorn. When
  the Spell-Packet strikes, however, it will act as a Spell-Packet, not a Weapon and
  will be defended against appropriately.
