description: |
  By calling the toxic wrath of nature the Druid can lash out disarming foes that seek to harm them.
  By Sacrificing one Life Point, the caster may call “Disarm [Weapon] by Disease.”

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, they may expend a Spike instead to
  call “Quick Disable [Arm] by Disease.”
