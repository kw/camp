description: |
  The Druid can heal damage to an Individual by drawing life from nearby flora,
  represented by their Life Tap pool. This cantrip works normally if the Druid is
  outside. If the character is inside they lose double points from their Life Tap
  pool for the same effect (to heal for 1 they would spend 2 Life Tap Points) unless
  they are touching a Plant creature (Including a character under the effects of
  Arboreal Transformation).

  The Life Tap pool is a number representing how much the Druid can heal for that Long Rest.
  Every time this Cantrip is used, the Druid can heal another individual up the Druid's
  Class-Level, subtracting the healing done from the Life Tap Pool.

  The Life Tap Pool resets to twice the Druid's Class-Level at the end of a Long Rest.
