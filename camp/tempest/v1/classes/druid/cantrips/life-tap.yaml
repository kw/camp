description: >
  The Druid can heal damage to an Individual up to the Druid’s class-level by drawing life from nearby flora.
  This cantrip only works if the Druid is outside.  If the character is inside they must be touching a tree
  with a trunk of at least four inches wide, a character under the effects of an Arboreal Transformation, or
  a plant creature with one hand to cast the spell. This spell will not work on the caster themself.

  This Power, although it refreshes immediately, can only be used to grant a limited amount of healing between
  Long Rests. This number, called the Life Tap Pool, is equal to the Druid’s class-level.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun the Life Tap Pool’s maximum is instead three times the
  Druid’s Class Level.
