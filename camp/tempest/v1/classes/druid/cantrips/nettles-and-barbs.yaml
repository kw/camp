description: >
  The Druid’s next un-Accented weapon attack gains the Poison accent as the weapon seeps poisonous liquid.

  If the Druid is currently in the Form of the Waning Moon and using a Claw weapon, they may call
  “2 Poison” on their next basic attack. If they expend a Spike while doing so, the call is
  altered to “Wounding 2 by Poison.”
