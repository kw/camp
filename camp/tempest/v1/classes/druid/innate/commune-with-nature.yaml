  This Power gives the Druid a limited ability to Refresh spent spell-slots.
  The Druid can spend a Short Rest in prayer, either alone or with others,
  re-focusing on their faith and the Greater power to whom they owe fealty.

  Between Long Rests, the Druid can refresh a number of Divine Novice
  spell-slots equal to two times their total levels in their Divine-casting
  Classes. This power may be used to refresh spells from any of this
  characterâ€™s Divine spellcasting classes, but this power does not stack with
  similar powers from those classes.

  This can be done in any increment and the Druid can refresh a Divine Adept
  spell-slot in the place of two Divine Novice spell-slots. Greater spell-slots
  take the place of three Novice spell-slots, and Master spell-slots take the
  place of four Novice spell-slots.

  Additional benefits come if this Power is used in an area of sacred faith
  (such as consecrated ground), with a personal rite (determined by the Druid).
  Up to three times per Long Rest, if the Druid uses this Power in that way,
  they can Refresh a Divine Novice spell-slot that does not count toward the
  total Refresh limit between Long Rests. This may occur in addition to
  Refreshing other spell-slots as normal.
