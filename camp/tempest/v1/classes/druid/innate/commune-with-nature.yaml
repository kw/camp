description: |
  The Druid can spend a Short Rest in meditation, feeling the strength of nature
  all around them, and drawing from its power and majesty.

  The Druid can perform this special meditation and refresh all of their expended
  Druid spell-slots.

  Additional benefits come if this meditation is done in an area of special natural
  power, sometimes called a Natural Locus. Doing so, the Druid gains three additional
  Divine Novice-tier Spell-Slots. These Spell-Slots last until the Druid completes a
  Long Rest. Additional benefits may be possible (see the Character Options chapter
  for more details).
