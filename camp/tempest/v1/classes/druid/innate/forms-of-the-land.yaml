name: Forms of the Land
requires: druid:1
description: >
  As the path of the Druid unfolds, they are granted a number of Forms -
  aspects of the land and environment they inhabit that they can take within
  themselves and express as newfound abilities. Each of these Forms are
  mutually exclusive with each other, and no character can have more than one
  Form active at any one time. By default, Forms expire on Long Rest, when the
  Druid resurrects, or if the Druid is hit by a Dispel effect specifically
  targeting a Form.

  Note: If the Druid changes or loses Form (such as with Metamorphosis), all
  Spells, Effects, and Conditions granted by Druid Powers “to Self” from the
  Druid Class expire.
