description: |
  The Druid can create a special area that is their grove. To do this, the Druid should do
  a small sanctification rite of their choosing, role-playing creating a connection with the
  grove for at least a minute. The grove will last until the beginning of the next Event (even
  if the Druid is not in attendance). The area must either be marked off with a border of green
  material (rope, engineering tape, etc.) not to exceed 100ft long, or be an obvious area (such
  as an actual clearing).

  The area may not have any permanent structures in it but may overlap with Druid groves that already
  exist, as long as the other Grove’s owner consents. The area should have some natural significance
  or beauty; just putting it on the lawn in front of the Tavern may cause Staff to claim the Grove is
  defunct. The Druid must provide an easily visible item card for the grove, indicating that it is a
  special place, its effects, the name of the Druid who created it, and any others presently attuned to
  it, which must be posted somewhere easily visible in the center of the grove itself.

  The grove has a number of properties:

    * The plants and vegetation there grow particularly well, as if perfectly watered with plenty of sunlight.
    * Plants and small animals within the grove are cheered, and generally feel safe and happy.
    * Plants and small animals within the grove are unusually hardy and difficult to be blighted, diseased,
      or harmed by outside magic.
    * The area is considered a Natural Locus, and should be conspicuously noted as such on the card.
    * The first time that the Druid discorporates during the given Event, they may Sacrifice an Eternal Blossom
      to resurrect with 1 Life Point at their Grove instead of visiting the Keepers.
