  Once per Event, after the Druid believes they have killed a creature (including and most
  often through a successful Deathblow) they remove the restriction on their ability to Grant Life.  
  This restriction to return someone to life in a particular Long Rest common among spells that
  have the Grant Life effect. This power will only lift the restriction once, and one it has
  does so, will not do so again.

  If the Druid knows the target was not killed this power fails to refresh their ability to Grant Life
  to another, however, the power is not wasted.

  Note: This power does not refresh the Spell-Slot used to Grant Life, it just removes the restriction
  the spell or power might have against doing so.
