description: |
  This power allows the character to determine if a targeted creature is a beast of nature, and its intent.
  The power lasts until the Druid moves their right foot or takes a Short Rest, whichever comes first.
  Until it ends, the Druid can ask any of the following questions as often as desired of any number of targets
  that they can see, but may only ask each target each question once.

  - “Do you have the [Animal/Beast] Type?”
  - “What kind of [Animal/Beast] are you?”
  - “Why are you here?”
  - “What are you feeling?”
  - “Do you mean me harm?”
  - “What is one of your Vulnerabilities?”
