cost: 3
requires: druid:2
description: >
  Early in every Druid’s life comes the time in which they must defend
  themselves, whether from the natural denizens of forest, or the “civilized”
  of the cities. Many learn that always having a means of defense at a moment’s
  notice can mean the difference between life and death. The Druid may gain up
  to two Short Claws as Natural weapons. These Claws should be no longer than
  36” long.

  If the Druid has Long Weapon proficiency, the Druid may gain a Long Claw (a
  single claw up to 48”) and a Short Claw (up to 36”) instead.

  If the caster is currently in the Form of the Rising Sun, and they have Great
  Weapon proficiency, they may gain a single Sharp Great Claw. This Claw should
  have a length between 48”- 90.”

  Switching between any of these options may be done at the completion of a
  Short Rest.
