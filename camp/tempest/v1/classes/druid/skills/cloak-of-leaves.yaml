description: >
  The Druid may protect themself from harm by drawing a camouflaging cloak about them and
  melding with the forest. They are empowered to seek shelter within the wood of a tree,
  becoming insubstantial to the real world so long as they do not move.

  After spending two Spikes, the Druid must gather their naturally-colored hooded cloak
  around them, Focus for a Quick 30, and call out "Grant Insubstantial to Self." They will
  retain the Insubstantial Condition until they choose to move, are knocked out of
  Insubstantial form by an Effect, or Dusk comes.

  Once the spell is ended, by whatever means, they must Dispel their insubstantial
  Condition by calling "Dispel Insubstantial." Remember that when Insubstantial, the player
  has a duty to inform anyone that inspects, closely interacts with, or plans to attack
  the character.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, the power costs no Spikes to activate,
  and may be done once per Short Rest.
