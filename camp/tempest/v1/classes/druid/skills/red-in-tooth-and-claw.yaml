description:
  Early in every Druid’s life comes the time in which they must defend
  themselves, whether from the natural denizens of forest, or the “civilized”
  of the cities. Many learn that always having a means of defense at a moment’s
  notice can mean the difference between life and death. The Druid may manifest
  up to two Short Claws as Natural weapons and can use them proficiently. These
  claws should be no longer than 36” long.
