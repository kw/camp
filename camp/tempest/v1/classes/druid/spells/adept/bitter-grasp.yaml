duration: Instantaneous, Short Rest
effect: Wounding
description: >
  The caster can coat their melee weapon with rime from the highest peaks. When the caster strikes another
  creature or their equipment, they can call “Wounding 2 by Ice.” This casting produces enough rime to use twice,
  though they need not be consecutive, however the spell (and all charges) expire at the end of a Short Rest.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, the caster may swing with this effect three times.
