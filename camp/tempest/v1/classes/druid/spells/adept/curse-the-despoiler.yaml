description: |
  Woe unto the enemy of the Druid who takes from the land in a way unsustainable. The Druid may charge a spell-ball
  with a powerful curse that prevents the individual from gathering from the land and using either their Prospecting,
  Foraging, or Scavenging skill until the next Long Rest or until the Druid that cast the spell removes the curse from
  them, usually requiring a quest.

  **Note**: An Apprentice Divine ritual may also remove this curse.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, they may add four points of their Life Tap pool when casting this spell.
  If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead the caster will add four points into their Life Tap pool if they have one.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, they may instead call “Long Obey by Fear: Do not Prospect, Forage, or Scavenge
  without my permission” instead of having to choose a single harvesting skill.
