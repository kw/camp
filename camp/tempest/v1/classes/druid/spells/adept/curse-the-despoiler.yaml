description:
  Woe unto the enemy of the Druid who takes from the land in a way unsustainable.
  The Druid may charge a Spell-Ball with a powerful curse that prevents the individual
  from gathering from the land and using either their Prospecting, Foraging, or
  Scavenging skill until the next Long Rest. During the Call, the Druid may prevent the
  other from using any or all of the Gathering Skills.
