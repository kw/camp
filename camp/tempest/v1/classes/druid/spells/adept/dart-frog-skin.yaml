description: >
  Until the Druid’s next Short Rest, each time the caster deals Poison accented damage by melee
  weapon delivery on a conscious foe and the target doesn’t Prevent it, the caster may call "Charged."

  Then the next time the Druid is hit by a melee attack they may spend a charge to verbally call against
  the creature that hit them "[Name or Description] 2 Poison.” You may have charges equal to your level
  in Druid at a time.
