description:
  The Druid gains three Counters against melee attacks. Each time the Counter is used,
  the Druid may call a Verbal “4 Poison” against the attacker. The skin is delicate,
  however, and will slough away and prematurely end the Spell if the caster throws
  Materia or makes a Weapon attack.
