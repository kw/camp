duration: Short Rest
effect: Grant Water Breathing, Grant Water Walk
description: >
  By taking on aspects of a creature that is the embodiment of the sea, the Druid becomes amphibious and
  able to swiftly swim, breathe water through newly erupted gills, and even skim along the surface of the water
  for short distances.

  While under the effects of this spell, the Druid is able to breathe water indefinitely, walk or run in
  water-based environments without restriction, and may expend a Spike to take ten steps on the surface of the water.
  While skimming the top of the water, if the Druid is unwilling or unable to expend further Spikes, they fall into
  the water, and may continue swimming from there.

  **Note**: This does not prevent environmental effects from hazardous liquids, either by touch or immersion, but may
  mitigate some of their effects.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, the duration of this effect is extended to Long Rest.
