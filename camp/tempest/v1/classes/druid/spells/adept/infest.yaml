description: |
  Upon casting this spell the Druid must expend a Spike, which causes the caster to gain two charges
  of “Piercing 1 by Disease” deliverable by melee weapon. These charges may be used at any time the
  Druid wishes, but all charges expire at the next Short Rest. The accent on this power may not be altered.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, the call for each swing is instead “Piercing 2 by Disease.”
