description: |
  This spell augments the target, increasing the life essence within, increasing their Maximum Life
  Point total by one. The Druid may not cast this on themselves.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, the caster adds three points to their Life Tap pool,
  if they have one. If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead the caster will add four points
  into their Life Tap pool if they have one.
