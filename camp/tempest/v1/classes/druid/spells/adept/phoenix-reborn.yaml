description: |
  Upon casting this spell the Druid must Sacrifice 10 Life Points (or however
  many they currently have if it is less).

  This powerful spell washes the target in flame and magical life. If the target
  is a corpse, it will bring it back to the living with 1 Life Point.

  This spell can only be used to bring one corpse back from the dead once per
  Long Rest. If a power refreshes a Long Rest ability, it can target the “one per
  Long Rest” limitation of this spell, allowing one more individual to be brought
  back to life by this spell.

  If used on an Undead, it will cause the creature to immediately discorporate and
  take Spirit Form.
