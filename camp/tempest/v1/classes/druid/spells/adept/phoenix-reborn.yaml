effect: Grant Life
description: >
  This powerful spell washes the target in flame and magical life. If the target is a corpse, it will bring
  it back to the living with 1 Life Point. If used on an Undead, it will cause the creature to immediately
  discorporate and take Spirit Form. Upon casting this spell the Druid suffers a Death Final effect. This spell
  can only be used to bring one corpse back from the dead once per Long Rest. If a power refreshes a Long Rest
  ability, it can target the “one per Long Rest” limitation of this spell, allowing one more individual to be
  brought back to life by this spell.

  If the Druid is in Rising Sun form instead of suffering a Death Final, they receive 10 Piercing by Flame Final
  to Self. Casting this spell adds seven points to the Druid’s Life Tap pool if they have one.
