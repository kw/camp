description: |
  By taking on aspects of a creature that is the embodiment of the sea, the Druid
  becomes amphibious and able to swiftly swim, breathe water through newly erupted
  gills, and even skim along the surface of the water for short distances.

  While under the effects of this spell, the Druid is able to breathe water
  indefinitely, walk or run in water-based environments without restriction,
  and may expend a Spike to take ten steps on the surface of the water. While
  skimming the top of the water, if the Druid is unwilling or unable to expend
  further Spikes, they fall into the water, and may continue swimming from there.

  Note: This does not prevent environmental effects from hazardous liquids, either
  by touch or immersion, but may mitigate some of their effects.
