description: >
  While wielding a staff and calling upon the power of the darkest night, the Druid’s staff is covered in
  writhing ethereal tendrils. The Druid can expend a Spike to do “Wounding 2 by Fear”, or alternatively,
  can expend a Spike to Counter any Effect that hits the staff by calling “Counter.”

  While this spell is active, the staff counts as a Claw for the requirements of Druid powers and spells.
