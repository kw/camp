description: >
  Vines with deadly thorns extend from the Druid’s hands and wrap around their melee weapon,
  causing pain but bringing power. When casting this spell, the Druid must Sacrifice a Life Point.
  After casting the Druid may expend a Spike to add the Wounding effect to their next blow. This may
  be done a number of times equal to half the Druid’s class-level. Additionally, the spell ends when
  the Druid is reduced to zero Life Points.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, the number of charges changes to the Druid’s class-level.
