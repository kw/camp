description: |
  The character will not suffer ill effects from in-game cold environments. Although
  the player should be aware of the dangers of actual cold temperatures, this will
  allow the character to travel through freezing cold areas, even other planes, without
  harm from the ambient cold, as long as they are wearing appropriate clothing, and can
  even melt ice by touch without ill effect to themself.

  Additionally, while the Spell is active, the caster can expend a Spike to Counter
  any attack with an Ice Accent by Calling “Counter, Warmth”.
