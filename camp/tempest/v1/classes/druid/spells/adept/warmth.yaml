duration: Short Rest
effect: Grant Resistance, Special
description: |
  The character will not suffer ill effects from in-game cold environments. Although the player
  should be aware of the dangers of actual cold temperatures, this will allow the character to
  travel through freezing cold areas, even other planes, without harm from the ambient cold, as
  long as they are wearing appropriate clothing, and can even melt ice by touch without ill effect
  to themself.

  The character is warm enough to gain Ice Resistance a number of times equal to the targetâ€™s
  Maximum Life Points.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, the number of resists is instead the Druids
  class-levels, if that is greater than their Maximum Life Points.
