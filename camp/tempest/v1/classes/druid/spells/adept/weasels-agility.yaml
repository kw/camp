duration: Short Rest
effect: Grant Resistance
description: >
  The Druid is able to tap into some of the deeper energies of the forest to become more
  bestial in nature. This spell will give the Druid the ability to resist the snares and
  traps that would slow or pin them down. The Druid may spend a Spike to Resist Root and
  Slow effects.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, instead of expending Spikes to resist
  these Root and Slow effects, the character instead gains a number of resists equal to
  their Maximum Life Points.
