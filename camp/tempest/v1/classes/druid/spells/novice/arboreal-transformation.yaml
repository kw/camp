description: >
  While this spell is active, and the Druid has their feet planted, the Druid gains the
  Plant Type and may count for any tree size requirements for spells for the caster and
  other character’s requirements. Keep in mind that the caster is not to be touched without
  consent, and that a Touch range spell can be cast with a packet in hand at 6.” If the
  caster moves after the spell is cast, the spell immediately ends.

  If the caster is currently in the Form of the Rising Sun, they are Inherently Slowed and
  the spell only ends when the character takes a Long Rest, or calls “Transformation Down.”
