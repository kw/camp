description: >
  Pulling the protection of the forest around them, the Druid hardens their skin with bark,
  Sacrificing a _Maximum_ Life Point for a Short Rest, giving them two points of Natural Armor.
  The process of growing the bark is an agonizing one, as shards of rough wood manifest beneath the skin.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, they may instead Sacrifice a Life Point to grant themself
  two points of Natural Armor.
