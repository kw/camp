description: |
  The Druid may bestow the blessings of the mighty oak to bolster their allies' fortitude granting
  a Protect against Poison and Disease. The Druid may expend a Spike to add one additional Target.

  If the caster is currently in the Form of the Rising Sun, the Druid may refresh one point of their
  Life Tap pool, if they have one. If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead the caster will
  add two points into their Life Tap pool if they have one.
