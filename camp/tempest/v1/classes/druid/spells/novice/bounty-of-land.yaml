description: >
  The Druid knows how to take from the land without ruining its natural beauty or despoiling its resources
  permanently. In return for this treatment, the land is kinder to the Druid. Until the Druid's next Long Rest,
  the next time the Druid would suffer negative consequences of gathering, the character may avoid them.
  The character can ignore the negative effects of Skinning a creature, Prospecting, or Foraging until their
  next Long Rest. The appropriate call for preventing this negative effect is “Counter.”

  Additionally, if the spell is cast with an Adept spell-slot, the character can put back a card and re-draw when
  Prospecting once, or alternatively, if the Druid has the Foraging skill, the Druid may take a single Bloom
  from an Ash Bin.

  If the caster is currently in the Form of the Rising Sun, the Druid may add two points of their Life Tap pool,
  if they have one. If the caster has the Peacecaster skill, instead the caster will add three points into their
  Life Tap pool if they have one.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, they may, once per event, instead take a Night Prize from an
  Ash Bin rather than a Bloom.

  If the Ash Bin does not have any of the appropriate resources and the Druid chooses not to gain any other results
  such as Life Tap pool from this spell, the spell slot is refunded.
