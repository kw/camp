description: |
  The Druid knows how to take from the land without ruining its natural beauty or
  despoiling its resources permanently. In return for this treatment, the land is
  kinder to the Druid. Until the Druid's next Long Rest, the next time the Druid
  would suffer negative consequences of Gathering, the character may Counter those
  consequences for themself.

  The character can Counter one negative effect of Scavenging a creature, Prospecting,
  or Foraging as long as it happens before they complete a Long Rest. The appropriate Call
  for preventing this negative effect is “Counter, Land's Bounty.”

  Additionally, if the character knows no Form spells, they can put back a card and
  re-draw when Prospecting.
