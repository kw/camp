description: |
  The caster can release a blast of power through a melee weapon that they are holding.
  When the caster strikes another creature or their equipment, they can release the energy
  causing “Short Disable [Arm] by Acid.”

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, they may call “Short Disable [Limb] by Ice” instead.
