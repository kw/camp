description: |
  When this spell is cast, the Druid empowers their next strike with the entangling vines of the forest,
  causing the victim to take a “Short Root by Poison.” If the weapon used for this strike is a natural
  weapon (such as a Claw), the wielder of the weapon may use that charge any time they wish, until they
  complete a Short Rest.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, they may instead call “Quick Root by Ice” twice.
