description: >
  Venomous thorns reach up from the underbrush, or through the cracks in the stones, striking at
  the legs and feet of the Druid’s enemies to disable their foe’s leg.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, the vines that are drawn forth are covered in
  venomous barbs, and Druid may call “[Name or Description] Quick Root by Poison” instead.
