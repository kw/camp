description: |
  Instead of searching a target, the Druid can quickly size up a helpless or willing creature and
  determine where to search. Please note that, like searching, this should not include any actual
  touching without express pre-negotiated consent. The caster can search instantaneously, by calling
  “Instruction: Give me your loot”, rather than waiting the Quick 100. This ability refreshes when
  loot is collected or the target indicates they have none.

  If the caster is currently in the Form of the Waning Moon, they may Mend 1 Armor to themselves the
  first time they receive at least one Coin while looting a downed creature.
