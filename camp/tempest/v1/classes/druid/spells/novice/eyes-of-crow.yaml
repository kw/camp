  With this Spell up, Instead of searching a target, the Druid can quickly size up a
  helpless or willing creature and determine where to search. Please note that, like
  searching, this should not include any actual touching without express pre-negotiated consent.

  The caster can search instantaneously, by calling “Instruction: Give me your loot”, rather
  than searching for the Quick 100. Although this can be done any number of times while the
  Spell is active, the caster must wait until they either have the Loot, or are told there is
  none, before it can be used again.
