description: >
  While under the effects of Cat’s Grace, the character can Counter the Damage and Effects
  from falling by Sacrificing two Life Points.

  If the caster is currently in the Form of the Waning Moon, the Druid may expend a Spike
  instead of Sacrificing the two Life Points. When using this power, the Druid should call ‘Cat’s Grace’.
