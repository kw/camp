  This Spell can only be cast while out of combat. The Druid is inhabited by the essence
  of the panther, the perfect predator. The panther is darkness and shadow, slipping in
  for the kill. While in the Lesser Form of the Hunting Panther, the character cannot cast
  Spells of any kind, but can activate the Powers of items and can cast the Enchanted Thorn
  Cantrip, but no others. The Druid has the following benefits:

    * +1 Base Spike Damage.
    * May manifest and Wield up to two Natural Short weapons proficiently.
    * May Counter the Damage and Effects caused by a fall by Sacrificing 2 Life Points and Calling “Counter, Catfall”.

  The Panther has the following additional abilities:

    * Expend a Spell-Slot to make a Weapon attack from behind that does 5 per Tier expended.
    * Expend a Novice Spell-Slot to make a Weapon attack that does “Short Slow by Agony”
    * Expend a Novice Spell-Slot to make a Weapon attack that does “Quick Root”
