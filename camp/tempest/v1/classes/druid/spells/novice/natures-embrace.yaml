description: |
  The Druid is able to cloak themselves from those that wish to find them. By calling for natureâ€™s
  aid this spell will protect them from the Expose effect. While touching a tree or laying in grass,
  the Druid has Obfuscated vs Expose.

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Waning Moon, the Duration is instead Long Rest, and may be used
  at any time while the Druid is fully surrounded by shadow.
