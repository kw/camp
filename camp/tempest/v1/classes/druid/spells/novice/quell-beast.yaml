  The Druid is at home with the creatures of the forest, and is able to soothe even the most
  dangerous of natural beasts. They may make a verbal call to a creature known to be an Animal or
  Beast and call “[Name or Description] Short Charm to Animal or Beast by Will.”

  If the Druid is in the Form of the Rising Sun, they may expend a Spike to instead call “Short Sleep
  to Animal or Beast by Will.”
