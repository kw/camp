description: |
  This Spell can be cast on up to six other individuals (and the Druid), but must
  be cast out-of-combat. The Druid must explain that each person in the casting will
  lose one Life Point if they consent. Once the Incantation is complete, the Druid
  asks each target (other than themself) in turn whether they are willing to give up
  life for this Spell. This can be “Are you willing to sacrifice your blood for the
  good of many?” or “May I have a sip of you?” or any similar question.

  As each one says they consent, the Druid will say “[Name or Description] 1 Final”.
  For each Life Point given up, the Druid adds 1 point to their Life Tap Pool. If they
  Sacrifice a Life Point themself, they add 2 more. This can add up to 10 points back
  into the Druid’s Life Tap Pool.
