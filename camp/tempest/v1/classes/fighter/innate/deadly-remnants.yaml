description: |
  The Fighter can use shattered weapons to block and do 1 point of damage.
  Using a shattered weapon will never do more than 1 point, regardless of
  other modifiers and enhancements. When a Shatter is taken to a wielded
  weapon that the Fighter will continue to use with this Power, they should
  call “Altered, Deadly Remnant,” to convey that the Shatter was taken, and
  altered. In addition, when picking up a shield from the ground that the
  character does not know the status of, they can treat the shield as if it
  were intact unless they are informed otherwise.
