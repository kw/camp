description: |
  The Fighter might not always be able to reach ranged combatants with their blades, but their words can sometimes assault a heart even from far away. After being hit by an Attack, Effect, or Damaging Power, anytime before the Fighter’s next short rest, the Fighter can verbally deliver a “Taunt 3 by Will” to the source of that Attack, Effect, or Damaging Power.

  If the fighter expends a Spike this power refreshes immediately.
