  The Fighter might not always be able to reach ranged combatants with their
  blades, but their words can sometimes assault a heart even from far away.
  After issuing a challenge, insult, or raging bellow, the Fighter can verbally
  deliver a "Taunt 3 by Will" to an opponent. If the Taunt is Prevented, the
  Fighter gains a +1 Bonus to their Spike Damage until they complete a Short Rest.
