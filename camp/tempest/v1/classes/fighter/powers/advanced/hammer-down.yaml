description: |
  Many fighters find that a good solid shield is the key to a sturdy defense. However, it can become a liability once destroyed, leaving the warrior both unbalanced and scrambling. The Fighter may call “Shatter [Item] by Force” once per Short Rest. If the Fighter is wielding a Great Weapon and no other weapons or shields, they may immediately Refresh this power, once per Short Rest, by expending a Spike.
