description: |
  Shouting a few words of encouragement, tactics, or sometimes even a
  simple _"look out behind you"_, the Fighter encourages one of their comrades
  to greatness. The Fighter must provide instruction and encouragement to an ally
  for about 5 seconds and should then follow it with the call immediately to
  provide one individual 2 refreshed Spikes and 3 Barrier by Will. The Fighter may
  not target themselves with this ability.

  This instruction and encouragement may be tactical in nature, for example: _"Valifar,
  shift left. Okay, now with me. Good. Now we push around the flank. Nice."_ would
  be an acceptable type of RP to engage in as long as it is approximately 5 seconds worth.
