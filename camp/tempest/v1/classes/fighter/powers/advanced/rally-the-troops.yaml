description: |
  Shouting a few words of encouragement, tactics, or sometimes even a simple _"look out behind you"_, the Fighter encourages one of their comrades to greatness. The Fighter must provide instruction and encouragement to an ally for a Quick 30 and should then follow it with the call immediately to provide one individual a Refreshed Spike and 2 Barrier by Will. The Fighter may not target themselves with this ability.

  This instruction and encouragement may be tactical in nature, for example: _"Valifar, shift left. Okay, now with me. Good. Now we push around the flank. Nice."_ would be an acceptable type of RP to engage in as long as it is a Quick 30 in duration.
