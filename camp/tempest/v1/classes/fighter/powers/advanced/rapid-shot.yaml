description: |
  While wielding a projectile weapon, if the fighter lands (hits the target, even if Countered) two consecutive shots on the same target, they may expend a Spike to make the second shot Wounding [X] where X is the Fighter’s Spike Damage. If the attack was already Wounding due to another Effect or Power, the call is “Piercing 3” instead.
