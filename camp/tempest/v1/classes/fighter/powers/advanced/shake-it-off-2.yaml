description: |
  The Fighter can reduce one Effect with a duration of “Quick” or “Short”
  to a Quick 30. When the duration ends, the character must let out a bellow,
  yell, or cry before taking any other actions. This can reduce the duration
  of Effects caused by the Fighter’s own Powers, such as Grit. Shake it Off II
  can be used while _drained_, _imprisoned_, or while affected by any Condition
  that normally stops a character from using Powers.
