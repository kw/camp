  The Fighter can reduce one Effect with a duration of “Quick 100” or “Short” to a Quick 30. When the duration ends, the character must let out a bellow, yell, or cry before taking any other actions. This can reduce the duration of Effects caused by the Fighter’s own Powers, such as Grit. Shake it Off II can be used while _drained_, _imprisoned_, or while affected by any Condition that normally stops a character from using Powers.
