description: |
  While wielding a projectile weapon, the fighter may set their ammunition aflame. For up to three shots with a projectile weapon, the archer may strike a foe and then call “Wounding [X] by Flame,” where [X] is their Spike Damage + 1. These shots need not be consecutive, but they expire when the archer takes a Short Rest.
