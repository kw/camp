description: |
  While wielding a projectile weapon, the fighter may set their ammunition
  aflame. For up to two shots with a projectile weapon, the archer may strike
  a foe and then call “Wounding 5 by Flame.” These shots need not be consecutive,
  but they expire when the archer takes a Short Rest.

  If the Fighter has at least 11 levels of Fighter they may instead fire 3 shots
  instead of 2.
