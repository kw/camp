description: |
  Some fighters find that it is not the overtly powerful blows, or special maneuvers that brings success, but the faithful repetition of a strike repeated a thousand times until it is bound into the very muscles of the fighter, able to be executed without thought. The Fighter may make a single melee weapon attack and call “Double 1.” If the Fighter is wielding a Great Weapon and no other weapons or shields, and expends a Spike the Call changes to “Double 2.” These calls may not be altered.
