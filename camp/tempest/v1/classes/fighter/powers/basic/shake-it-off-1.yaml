description: |
  The Fighter can reduce one Effect with a duration of “Quick 100” or “Short”
  to a Quick 30. When the duration ends, the character must let out a bellow, yell,
  or cry before taking any other actions. This can reduce the duration of Effects
  caused by the Fighter’s own Powers, such as Grit.
