description: |
  Knowing how to properly maintain oneâ€™s equipment can mean the difference
  between life and death. The Fighter gains a pool of Maintenance Points equal
  to 10 plus their Fighter Class-Level that refreshes upon the completion of a
  Long Rest. They may spend a Focus Quick 100 roleplaying patching their own
  armor and use any amount of Points to apply them as Mending to their worn
  armor. When the character uses the Reinforce Skill, they gain two Maintenance Points.
