description: |
  The Fighter gains the Heavy Armor skill.

  The flexibility of Heavy armor is often overlooked, but veterans used to
  wearing these sorts of armor know that each scale is part of a whole, greater
  than its pieces. As long as the character is physically representing and using
  at least 7 points of physical armor, and has at least one point of armor
  remaining, they may, once per Short Rest, choose to Counter one Wounding attack.
