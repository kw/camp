description: |
  The Fighter gains the Ironclad Armor (2) Skill.

  After years of living in the heaviest of armors, the Fighter has learned
  to depend on their armor’s durability, especially in the thickest of battles.
  Whenever the Fighter is physically representing at least 10 Location Points on
  their chest, once per Short Rest, if the Fighter is using Physical Armor and
  has at least one Armor Point remaining, they may “Counter” one Piercing
  attack that they receive.
