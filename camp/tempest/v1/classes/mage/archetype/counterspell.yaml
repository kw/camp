name: Counterspell
requires: mage:10
call: "Counter"
target: Self
duration: Instantaneous
refresh: Immediate
effect: Counter
description: >
  If the Mage is struck by a spell-packet that matches the Effect call of one
  of their prepared spells, the Mage may expend that spell slot immediately
  and call “Counter” as long as the call includes the Effect in a spell that
  the Mage has prepared, and has available spell slots for. Cantrip effects may
  be used to counterspell, but consume a Novice Spell slot to do so.

  **Note**: Counterspell cannot be used while Silenced.
