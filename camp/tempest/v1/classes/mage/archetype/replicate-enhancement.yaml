  When casting a prepared non-damaging touch spell, the number of targets is increased by one.
  The spell must have a target of Individual, shield, or armor, the delivery must be Touch
  (downcasts to Touch are not affected by this power), and the spell must come from the Basic
  Class: Mage Spell List (this includes both Novice and Adept).

  Once they achieve 7th level Mage they may add one additional target per cast.
