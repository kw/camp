name: Ghost Hand
incant: "...to form a ghostly hand."
call: “Insubstantial”, “Cure Insubstantial”
target: Self
duration: Slow Count of 15
refresh: Focus Slow 300
accent: Force
effect: Grant Insubstantial, Cure
description: >
  The caster must immediately drop everything they are holding and will go insubstantial.
  They then have a Slow Count of 15 to perform one action and return to the approximate
  spot where they completed the incant. At the end of the Slow Count of 15 the caster
  must immediately return to where they were at the start of the spell, and cure their
  insubstantial Condition.

  The action must be one of the following: pushing a spot with one finger, picking up a
  small object (no larger than two fists) and placing it/throwing it, pulling on something
  with one hand, gesturing to another individual with one hand, or tapping a character on
  the shoulder (if the character has prior explicit consent only). If this movement triggers
  a trap, the Mage will be considered to have tripped the trap while momentarily physical,
  and therefore take the effects of the trap per the normal Insubstantial rules. Note that
  this spell offers interaction normally unavailable to Insubstantial creatures. This cantrip
  can only be cast out of combat.
