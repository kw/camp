description: |
  The caster must immediately drop everything they are holding and will go
  insubstantial. They then have a Slow Count of 15 to perform one action and
  return to the approximate spot where they completed the incant. At the end
  of the Slow Count of 15 the caster must immediately return to where they were
  at the start of the spell, and cure their insubstantial Condition.

  The action must be one of the following: pushing a spot with one finger,
  picking up a small object (no larger than two fists) and placing
  it/throwing it, pulling on something with one hand, gesturing to another
  individual with one hand, or tapping a character on the shoulder
  (if the character has prior explicit consent only). If this movement
  triggers a trap, the Mage will be considered to have tripped the trap
  while momentarily physical, and therefore take the effects of the trap
  per the normal Insubstantial rules.This cantrip can only be cast out of combat.

  Note: This spell offers interaction normally unavailable to Insubstantial creatures.
