description: >
  By using this Cantrip on an item **while at an Arcane Locus**, the Mage may learn all of the magical
  properties of an item.

  Although it is easy for anyone to determine if an item is magical or special in nature and read the
  information card to discover obvious properties, this cantrip will allow the player to look at an
  item’s folded information card (even if they don’t meet the requirements on the outside) to know its
  exact properties. Only the caster will be allowed to read the properties, although if they choose to,
  they can open the item card to make the properties discoverable to anyone. If the card says “Relic”
  on the public portion, this spell has no effect.

  **Note**: By game-design, Identify may have other specific uses.
