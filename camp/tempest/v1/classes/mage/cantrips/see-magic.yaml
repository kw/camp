  See Magic gives the Mage the ability to detect magical emanations from enchantments,
  active spells (including summoned armor), or magical items. Once cast, the Mage can
  ask any or all of the following questions of as many targets as desired. The Mage can
  do this until they cast another spell, says anything that is not one of the questions,
  takes damage, takes an Effect, or completes a Short Rest:

    * “[Name or Description] Discern: What non-Inherent Conditions do you have?”
    * “[Name or Description] Discern: How many points of summoned armor do you have?”
    * “[Name or Description] Discern: What items are you carrying that are magical?”
    * “[Name or Description] Discern: What was the last spell you cast?”
    * “[Name or Description] Discern: Are you a Magical Beast, Automata, or Construct?”
