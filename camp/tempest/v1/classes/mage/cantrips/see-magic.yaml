  See Magic gives the Mage the ability to detect magical emanations from
  enchantments, active spells (including summoned armor), or magical items.
  Once cast, the Mage can ask any or all of the following questions of as
  many targets as desired. The Mage can do this until they cast another
  spell, says anything that is not one of the questions, takes damage,
  takes an Effect, or completes a Short Rest:

    * “What non-Inherent Conditions do you have?”
    * “How many points of summoned armor do you have?”
    * “What items are you carrying that are magical?”
    * “What was the last spell you cast?”
    * “[Are you a Magical Beast, Automata, or Construct?”
