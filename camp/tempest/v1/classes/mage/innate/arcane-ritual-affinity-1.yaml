  The Mage can use their understanding of Arcane magic to help navigate the
  complexities of Arcane Ritual magic. The Apprentice Arcane Ritual Magic
  skill costs them one fewer Character Point. Once they achieve 7th level Mage
  they can purchase Journeyman Arcane Ritual Magic skill for one fewer Character
  Point. If the Mage has already purchased either of these skills, they get one
  Character Point back for each. Once they achieve 12th level Mage, they can
  purchase Greater Arcane Ritual Magic skill for one fewer Character Point.
