name: Arcane Study
requires: mage:1
description: >
  The Mage can meditate and commune with the Weave to rebuild focus and refresh their spell slots.
  The Mage can spend a Short Rest studying their spell-book, making notes on spells, or practicing their incants quietly.

  Between Long Rests, the Mage can refresh a number of Arcane Novice spell-slots equal to two
  times their total levels in their Arcane-casting Classes. This power may be used to refresh spells
  from any of this characterâ€™s Arcane spellcasting classes, but this power does not stack with similar
  powers from those classes.

  This can be done in any increment and the Mage can refresh a Arcane Adept spell-slot in the place of
  two Arcane Novice spell-slots. Greater spell-slots take the place of three Novice spell-slots, and
  Master spell-slots take the place of four Novice spell-slots.

  Additional benefits come if this Power is used in an area of concentrated magical power (such as an
  Arcane Locus), with a personal rite (determined by the Mage). Up to three times per Long Rest, if the
  Mage uses this Power in that way, they can Refresh a Arcane Novice spell-slot that does not count
  toward the total Refresh limit between Long Rests. This may occur in addition to Refreshing other
  spell-slots as normal.
