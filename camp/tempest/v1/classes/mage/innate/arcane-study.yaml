description: |
  The Mage can meditate and commune with the Weave to rebuild focus and refresh
  their Arcane Spell-slots. The Mage can spend a Short Rest studying their
  spell-book, making notes on spells, or practicing their incants quietly.

  The Mage can perform this special study and refresh all of their expended Arcane
  spell-slots. If the Mage has used any other Innate Power from another class to
  refresh their Arcane spell slots this long rest they may not use Arcane Study.

  Alternatively, if the Mage studies in an area of powerful arcane magic (such as
  an Arcane Locus), and performs a personal rite (determined by the Mage), the Mage
  gains three additional Novice-tier Spell-Slots. These Spell-Slots last until the
  Mage completes a Long Rest. Additional benefits may be possible (see the Character
  Options chapter for more details).
