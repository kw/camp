  This Mage power gives them incredible versatility and ability to continue
  their arcane assistance in battle in exchange for some obvious vulnerability
  during the channeling process.

  Once per Event, without access to their book or the normal meditation process
  Mage may engage in an incredibly obvious and loud magical gathering of essence
  for about 1 minute and then announce loudly “Beginning to Channel Arcane Energies”
  and begin a Focus for a Quick 100. At the end of this entire process the Mage
  instantaneously Refreshes all their Arcane Novice and Adept Spell Slots. If
  interrupted during this Focus Quick count the power is considered expended so
  the Mage should do this in an area they are certain they will not be interrupted.

  Upon attaining the 15th level in Mage this Innate Power also refreshes Arcane Greater spell slots.
