name: Eye of the Void
requires:
  - mage:9
  - apprentice-arcane-ritual
description: >
  When the Mage is a Primary Ritualist in an Arcane Ritual, when they pull their final
  card from the Dark Territory Hand, they may also pull one additional card from the hand.
  When the second card is revealed, the spirits of the Void will give them a premonition
  of the outcome of the second card. This premonition is given by the attending Ritual Marshal
  as “Weal (Success), Woe (Failure), or Geas (Alteration).“ This does not replace the first
  drawn card, merely suggests what the outcome of the second card might have been.
