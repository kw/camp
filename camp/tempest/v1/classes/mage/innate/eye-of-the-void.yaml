  When the Mage is a Primary Ritualist in an Arcane Ritual, when they pull their
  Final Card from the Dark Territory Hand, they may also pull one additional card
  from the Hand. When the second card is revealed, the Lantern Spirit will give them
  a premonition of the outcome of the second card. This premonition is given by the
  attending Lantern Spirit as “Weal (Success), Woe (Failure), or Geas (Alteration).“
  This does not replace the first drawn card, merely suggests what the outcome
  of the second card might have been.
