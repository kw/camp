  When casting a non-damaging touch Mage spell, the number of targets is
  increased by one. The spell must have a target of Individual, shield, or
  armor, the listed Delivery must be Touch (Spells cast as Touch do not
  get this benefit).

  Once they achieve 7th level Mage they may add one additional target
  per cast. At 12th, they gain a third additional target.
