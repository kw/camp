description: >
  The target of this spell feels their limb twisted and crushed by an invisible force. An arm will become
  useless and will be forced to drop whatever that hand is holding. A disabled leg is unable to hold weight.
  When the packet strikes the target, the caster must choose a limb and make the call. If the packet appears
  to hit a specific limb, or if it hits a weapon or equipment held by a specific limb, that limb must be
  called, even if it is already Disabled. If the caster expends a Spike an additional Spell ball is charged.
