name: Ease Lock
incant: '"... to aid in unlocking the works of magic", Special Focus'
call: Explanation
target: Individual
delivery: Touch
accent: Will
duration: Special
effect: Special
description: >
  The Mage can allow the target character (who cannot be the Mage themself) to make one
  attempt on a magical lock. The target must be holding a lockwand when the incantation
  is complete, and the Mage must Focus from the moment the incantation is completed until
  the target finishes their attempt (or gives up, puts down the wand, etc.). Each casting
  will grant one attempt on the lock.

  If the Mage’s Focus is interrupted, the magical lock must be immediately tripped (the lockwand
  should touch the wire). The Mage must use “[Name and Description of lockwand-holder] Instruction:
  Touch the lockwand to the wire.” Note that a character with a Power like Thief’s Touch might be
  able to continue on from that point anyway.
