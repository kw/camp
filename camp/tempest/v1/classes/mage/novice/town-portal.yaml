duration: Long Rest
effect: Grant Insubstantial, Cure Insubstantial, Instruction
description: >
  This spell must be cast Out Of Combat and the Mage may only have one active Town Portal trigger and sigil at any one time.
  The Mage inscribes a location, outside, with a symbol of their choosing. The Symbol must be at least 6” by 6” and must be
  visible from at least one angle by a person standing on the ground.

  Until the Mage finishes a Long Rest, they may trigger this power in order to “Grant Insubstantial to Self” and are compelled
  to walk directly to their inscribed symbol and touch it. The Mage should call "Town Portal, Insubstantial!" when this occurs.

  If this spell is cast using a higher tier spell slot, the caster may designate up to two additional targets per tier. Thus,
  with a Master Level Slot, 7 people would be transported, including the caster. These individuals must all be within Touch
  range when the Power is triggered. The caster should make it clear to the targets who is being affected and how. The Mage
  may use "Instruction" to tell the players that their character is going to be Insubstantial, can only walk, and should
  Call "Town Portal, Insubstantial." In addition, all affected characters must attempt to remain within melee distance of
  the caster until they have reached the Sigil, or have been cured of Insubstantial.

  When the travelers reach the sigil's original location and the Mage touches the sigil, the caster calls
  “[Name or Description] Cure Insubstantial to Insubstantial” on all the travelers. If, instead, the Symbol is no longer
  there or otherwise defaced, the caster immediately dies.

  Should the caster die, or the spell ends, all effects and conditions related to this spell end.

  **Note**: This means the caster is Dead, but no longer Insubstantial, as all Conditions are removed when dead. Removing the
  Insubstantial Condition will not remove any other part of this Spell's effects: the Mage (and other Targets) will still
  need to walk back to the original location and will still die if the sigil has been moved or defaced.
