name: Arcane Charge
cost: 2
requires:
  - mage:4
  - replicate-enhancement
description: >
  When the Replicate Enhancement Passive is used, the Mage may choose to reduce the number of targets
  by one and instead place the additional charge granted into a Spell-Ball. This allows the Mage to
  retain the charge for later use, or deliver the charge at range.
