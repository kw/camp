description: >
  While before, the nuances of the arcane might have been foreign to the Mage, now,
  it’s become second nature. The four arcane affinities: Flame, Ice, Lightning, and Acid,
  are now always close to the Mage’s fingertips.

  When casting the Mage Bolt cantrip, the Mage may choose to use the Acid, Flame, Ice, or
  Lightning accent instead of Force.
