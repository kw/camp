name: Arcane Bridge
incant: "...to create an arcane bridge."
target: Special
duration: Special
accent: Force
delivery: Packet (Spell-Ball)
effect: Special
description: >
  This spell must be cast upon a spell-ball that has been marked with a symbol that is special to the caster.
  The packet is then thrown and once it comes to rest, the Mage can briefly touch the ground to create an ethereal,
  translucent bridge of pure magical power that extends from that spot to the thrown spell-ball.

  The bridge is taxing to maintain, and once six Individuals have passed over it, the magical force will dissipate.
  The bridge will likewise dissipate if the anchoring spell-ball is moved in any way. This spell can be cast with a
  Greater magic spell-slot to allow ten individuals across, or a Master spell slot to allow any number of individuals
  to cross as long as the caster maintains Focus. Severe changes in level between the two ends cause the bridge to
  dissipate immediately, so this spell cannot be used to help climb or descend more than about four stair-steps up or down.
