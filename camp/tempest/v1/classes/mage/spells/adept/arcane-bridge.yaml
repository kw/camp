effect: It Can Be Seen
description: |
  This spell must be cast upon a Spell-Ball that has been marked with a symbol that
  is special to the caster. The Spell-Ball is then thrown and once it comes to rest,
  the Mage can briefly touch the ground to create an ethereal, translucent bridge of
  pure magical power that extends from that spot to the thrown Spell-Ball.

  The bridge is taxing to maintain, and once six Individuals have passed over it,
  the magical force will dissipate. The bridge will likewise dissipate if the anchoring
  Spell-Ball is moved in any way. Severe changes in level between the two ends cause
  the bridge to dissipate immediately, so this spell cannot be used to help climb or
  descend more than about four stair-steps up or down.

  Enhancement: Greater Slot: Ten individuals can cross the bridge before it ends.
  Enhancement: Master Slot: Any number of individuals can cross as long as the caster
  maintains Focus.
