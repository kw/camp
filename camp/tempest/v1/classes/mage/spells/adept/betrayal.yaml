  The Mage charges two Spell-Balls with the energy of madness and pain. Each charge
  will cause an individual to strike out at those around it, attempting to harm anyone
  they can reach. A Berserked creature will attack the nearest creature until it is
  slept or drops to 0 Life Points. They will not use Powers, and will stop attacking a
  creature once it falls. If the caster expends a Spike an additional Spell-Ball is charged.
