description: >
  When cast, this spell charges two Spell balls that cause the items struck
  to be Shattered. If the spell-ball strikes a shield or weapon held by an
  individual, then that shield or weapon must be targeted. If the spell-ball
  strikes the individual, the caster can choose from a held item, physical
  armor, or some other visible possession. The target may be an unattended
  physical item. Special items are generally *immune* and their holder may call
  out “No Effect” in these cases.
