description: >
  The target of the spell will feel their attitude change and shift, becoming
  compliant to the casterâ€™s will. The target is Dominated to the caster for a
  Short Rest, or until the target is reduced to zero Life Points. This spell is
  exhausting to the caster, and thus the caster may only have a single target
  dominated with this spell at any one time, and, in addition, this spell may
  only be cast once per Long Rest.
