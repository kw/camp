description: |
  This spell must be cast while inside a white cord, rope, or the like that is
  no longer than 10 feet long that has been laid down to make a continuous shape
  (usually a circle). At the completion of the Incantation, the lain rope cannot
  be purposefully moved by anyone other than the caster, and anyone who attempts
  to do so should be informed by use of "Instruction: You may not move the rope."
  or similar. This does not prevent people from crossing the threshold of the
  cord, rope, or the like.

  Should the rope be moved purposefully by the caster, the spell ends. This should
  be communicated to others trying to touch or manipulate it.

  As long as the caster is completely inside the circle (regardless of whether they
  have remained in the circle), they can charge a Spell-Ball with elemental energy
  by calling “Spell-Ball Charged”. Only one Spell-Ball may be charged at a time
  with this spell.

  The Spell-Ball will cause "Wounding 3 by [Acid / Flame / Ice / Lightning] Damage."
  The Mage may charge a number of Spell-Balls with this spell equal to their Mage
  class-level. The Mage can continue to do this until they complete a Short Rest
  or until the Circle is moved, broken, or Dispelled. Incidental/accidental movement
  of the circle will not disturb the spell (such as a foot moving the cord accidentally).

  The Circle can be Dispelled by Dispel Magic and similar magic.

  Note: The caster may only have one Circle active at any given time, regardless of origin.
