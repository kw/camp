description: >
  By casting this spell inside an Arcane Locus, the Mage may learn all of the
  magical properties of all non-relic items within the locus. Although it is
  easy for anyone to determine if an item is magical or special in nature and
  read the information card to discover obvious properties, this spell will
  allow the player to look at the folded information card (even if they don’t
  meet the requirements on the outside) to know its exact properties. If any
  card says “Relic” on the public portion, this spell will not function on it.
  Only the caster will be allowed to read the properties, although if they
  choose to, they can open each item card to make the properties discoverable
  to anyone.

  **Note**: By game-design, Identify may have other specific uses.
