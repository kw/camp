description: |
  The Mage may learn all of the magical properties of all designated non-relic items.
  Although it is easy for anyone to determine if an item is magical or special in nature
  and read the information card to discover obvious properties, this spell will allow
  the player to look at the folded information card (even if they donâ€™t meet the
  requirements on the outside) to know its exact properties.

  Only the caster will be allowed to read the properties, although if they choose to,
  they can open each item card to make the properties discoverable to anyone.

  Note: While this spell allows relics to be identified, the object may still be
  Obfuscated or otherwise masked, and Identification may not reveal all its properties.
  In addition, by game-design, Improved Identify may have other specific uses.
