description: >
  This spell gives the Mage a limited ability to absorb magical power and use
  it themself. They gain a Protect against Packets that do damage. When the
  Protect is used, it will also absorb the magic of the attack. The amount of
  Power that can be used depends on the damage called with the Power. If the
  Mage does not have a spell-ball in hand, the Mage can Refresh one exhausted
  Novice spell-slot. If the Mage has a spell-ball in hand and the packet does
  damage, they can call “Spell-ball Charged!” and give the spell-ball the
  ability to do the same damage as the original Power, although whatever accent
  that Power had will be changed to Force. The call for the charged spell-ball
  is “Wounding [Damage] by Force.”
