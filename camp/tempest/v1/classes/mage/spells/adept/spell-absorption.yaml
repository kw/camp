description: |
  This spell gives the Mage a limited ability to absorb magical power and use
  it themself. They gain a Protect against damaging Materia. When the
  Protect is used, it will also absorb the magic of the attack. The amount of
  Power that can be used depends on the damage called with the Power. If the
  Mage does not have a Spell-Ball in hand, the Mage can Refresh one expended
  Novice Spell-Slot.

  If the Mage has a Spell-Ball in hand, they can call “Spell-ball Charged!”
  and give the Spell-Ball the ability to do the same damage as the original
  Power, although whatever accent that Power had will be changed to Force.
  The call for the charged Spell-Ball is “Wounding [Damage] by Force.”
