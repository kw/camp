description: >
  Twisting fate and warping reality, the Mage lays bare their opponent’s
  weakness for all to exploit. A single spell ball is charged with this
  spell, but if a Greater spell slot is used, the duration becomes Long,
  like so: “Long Grant Vulnerability to Force.” If this spell is cast using
  a Master Spell slot, the call gains the “Final” modifier, ie “Long Grant
  Vulnerability to Force Final.”
