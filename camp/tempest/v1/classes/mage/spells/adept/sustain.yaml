incant: ...to sustain the breath.
call: Explanation
target: Individual
duration: Short Rest
delivery: Touch
accent: None
effect: Immunity
description: >
  The Mage designates up to 3 individuals creating a bridge between the target
  and the element of air. The targets cease to breathe the air around them, and
   therefore can survive in airless environments such as being underwater, and
   gain immunity to the Gas Accent and any similar Effects that are obviously
   breath driven. The appropriate call for this defense is “Immune.”
