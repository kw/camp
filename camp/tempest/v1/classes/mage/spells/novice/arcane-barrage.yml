effect: Wounding
description: |
  After this spell is cast, the caster gains the ability to charge a Spell-Ball
  with power by simply holding it and calling "Spell-Ball Charged!" Each Spell-Ball
  charged in this way will do Wounding 1 when it strikes. Only one Spell-Ball can
  be charged at a time, and Arcane Barrage goes down if the caster completes a
  Short Rest, casts another Spell, or charges a fifth Spell-Ball using Arcane
  Barrage. Unlike most spells that charge multiple Spell-Balls, Warcaster applies
  to all balls of this spell.

  Enhancement: Adept Slot: The caster can charge 10 Spell-Balls with Wounding 2.
  Enhancement: Greater Slot: The caster can charge 15 Spell-Balls with Wounding 3
  and the caster may replace the Accent with the Arcane, Mind, or Will Accent,
  changing the accent on each attack.
