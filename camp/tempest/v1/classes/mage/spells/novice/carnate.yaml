description: |
  The Mage can use this spell to shove an incorporeal creature or object fully
  onto their plane, making it vulnerable to many normal attacks. If the Carnate
  Spell-Ball is Prevented, one more Spell-Ball can be charged with this same spell
  by calling “Spell-Ball Charged!”. If the second Carnate Spell-Ball is also
  Prevented the Mage may call “[Name or Description] 5 Piercing by Will to Insubstantial.”
