duration: Short Rest
refresh: Spell
effect: Disable
description: |
  The target of this spell feels their limb twisted and crushed by an invisible
  force. An arm will become useless and will be forced to drop whatever that
  hand is holding. A disabled leg is unable to hold weight. When the Spell-Ball
  strikes the target, the caster must choose a limb and make the Call. If the
  Spell-Ball appears to hit a specific limb, or if it hits a weapon or equipment
  held by a specific limb, that limb must be called, even if it is already disabled.

  Enhancement: Expend a Spike during Incantation: An additional Spell-Ball is charged.
