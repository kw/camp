description: >
  The Mage may, after casting this spell, understand one piece of written work regardless of the
  language it was written in, or any code that has been used to obfuscate the meaning. The work
  to be deciphered may be no longer than one page of script. Documents that can be deciphered in
  this way will have the translated text attached or accompanying it. There will be some codes or
  even languages that are resistant to this spell and thus cannot be deciphered (any that lack the
  accompanying translation). Once cast, the document is readable by anyone with the ability to read,
  but the original appearance of the page can be viewed too.
