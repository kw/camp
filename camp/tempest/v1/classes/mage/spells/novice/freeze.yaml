description: >
  When this spell is cast, it will charge two spell-balls at the same time.
  The spell-balls must be thrown separately. When struck by this spell, the
  target is immediately encased in ice. For the duration, the block of ice
  will protect them, but will also stop all movement and use of Powers (as normal
  for imprisoned). If the caster expends a Spike an additional Spell ball is charged.
