effect: Grant Summoned Armor
description: |
  The caster grants themself 3 Summoned Armor Points. This is considered a
  new “suit” or armor and is not stackable with other sources of summoned
  armor. The Mage may instead change the duration of the spell to be
  Short and grant themselves 4 points of Summoned Armor instead.
