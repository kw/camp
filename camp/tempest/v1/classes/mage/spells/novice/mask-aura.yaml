description: |
  The Mage may put a protective bubble around one individual, making the character difficult
  to Discern. Whenever the recipient is targeted by a Discern by Mind, they must answer
  “Counter, Masked”. This protection lasts until the recipient completes or otherwise
  receives the effect of a Short (or Long) Rest, regardless of the number of Discerns
  they Counter. Mask Aura can only be cast out of combat in a quiet and generally
  peaceful area and the effects of the Spell must be explained clearly to the recipient.
