call: "Short Repel by Mind"
target: Individual

duration: Short Rest
refresh: Spell

description: |
  The Mage reaches out with their will, putting into others a deep compulsion to stay away.
  Upon completion of the incantation, two Spell-Balls will be charged with the ability to Repel others.

  Enhancement: Adept Slot: Four balls are charged instead of two.
  Enhancement: Greater Slot: The Spell charges a single Spell-Packet, but gives the Mage the ability
  to continue casting the spell as if it were a cantrip until the next Short Rest. Although multiple
  Spell-Balls are charged at once, they must be thrown one at a time.
