description: |
  This spell must be cast Out Of Combat and the Mage may only have one active
  Town Portal trigger and sigil at any one time. Upon casting this spell, the
  Mage inscribes a location, outside, within touch range, with a symbol of their
  choosing. The Symbol must be at least 6” by 6” and must be visible from at
  least one angle by a person standing on the ground.

  At any time until the Mage finishes a Long Rest, they may trigger this power
  in order to “Grant Insubstantial to Self” and are compelled to walk directly
  to their inscribed symbol and touch it. The Mage should call "Town Portal,
  Insubstantial!" when this occurs.

  If this spell is Enhanced, all Individuals must be within Touch range when
  the Power is triggered. The caster should make it clear to the targets who
  are being affected and how. The Mage may use "Instruction" to tell the
  players that their character is going to be Insubstantial, can only walk,
  and should Call "Town Portal, Insubstantial." In addition, all affected
  characters must attempt to remain within melee distance of the caster
  until they have reached the Sigil, or have been cured of Insubstantial.

  When the travelers reach the sigil's original location and the Mage touches
  the sigil, the caster calls “[Name or Description] Cure Insubstantial to
  Insubstantial” on all the travelers. If, instead, the Symbol is no longer
  there or otherwise defaced, the caster immediately dies.

  Should the caster die, or the spell ends, all effects and conditions
  related to this spell end.

  **Note**: This means the caster is Dead, but no longer Insubstantial,
  as all Conditions are removed when dead. Removing the Insubstantial
  Condition will not remove any other part of this Spell's effects: the
  Mage (and other Targets) will still need to walk back to the original
  location and will still die if the sigil has been moved or defaced.

  Enhancement: Adept Slot: Two additional passengers can be taken.
  Enhancement: Greater Slot: Four additional passengers can be taken.
  Enhancement: Master Slot: Six additional passengers can be taken.
