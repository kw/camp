description: |
    Whenever the Rogue performs a basic Spike attack from behind or performs a Sinister Strike, the blow does +1 Base Damage.

    In addition, if the blow is not Countered, the Rogue may refresh a Spike. This Refresh may be done a number of times equal to the Rogueâ€™s Maximum Spikes per Long Rest. However, each unique target may only grant one Spike Refresh to the Rogue; this limitation is reset when the Rogue Short Rests.
