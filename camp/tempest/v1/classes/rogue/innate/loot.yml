description: |
    Instead of searching a target, the Rogue can quickly size up a helpless or willing creature and determine where to search. Please note that, like searching, this should not include any actual touching without express pre-negotiated consent. The Rogue can search instantaneously, rather than waiting the Quick 100. This ability refreshes when loot is collected or the target indicates they have none.
