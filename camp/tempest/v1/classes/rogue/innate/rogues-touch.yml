description: |
    While attempting a mundane lock, the character can call “Rogue’s Touch” if there is some negative effect to failing the lock, or failing to pick it in a certain amount of time. This will not Counter the negative effect, but will allow the character to try again from the beginning. So if the Rogue had to pick a lock within one minute or take a Death Effect, they could take the minute, and as soon as the fact that there was a consequence for failure announced, they could call “Rogue’s Touch” and take another minute. If they do not immediately re-start the attempt or totally disengage from the lock, the consequence occurs.

    While attempting a magical lock, the Rogue can continue to attempt the lock even if they touch the wire with their lock wand by expending a use of this ability. They must move the lock wand so that the alarm is no longer triggered and then may continue on without restarting.

    At 10th level, the Rogue may do this twice on the same lock.
