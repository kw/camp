description: |
    Once used, this Power grants the Rogue the ability to, at-will, imbue their Thrown Weapon attacks with the Wounding Effect, however, their damage on that attack is then limited to a maximum of 2. This power will only last until the Rogue receives or completes a Short Rest.

    Note: The Rogue may choose to forgo the Imbue on any given attack, which also removes the damage restriction for that single attack.
