description: |
    In the right hands, anything is a weapon - a pencil, a cup, or even a coin. The Rogue may use a Spike to “Throw” a non-weapon object as a weapon once to call “[Name or Description] [X],” where X is the Rogue’s current Spike Damage. The player should generally mime throwing an object and be careful not to throw anything that can cause actual harm.
