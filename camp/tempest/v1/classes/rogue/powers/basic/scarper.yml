description: |
    The Rogue can Cure one Condition that keeps them captive. This can be Imprisoned, Slowed, or Rooted. This can also be used to escape from one set of physical bonds. This includes tied ropes, shackles, the chain attaching the Rogue to the wall, or other bonds, but not enclosures like prisons or cages. This will not free the Rogue from Serious Knots.
