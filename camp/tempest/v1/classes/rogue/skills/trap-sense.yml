description: |
    Any time the Rogue is affected by a trap, they can use this Power as a Counter, although it does not completely negate the effects of the trap. If the trap does enough damage that the Rogue would drop to 0 or fewer Life Points, instead they are reduced to one Life Point. If the Rogue takes a Death Effect, they take a Drain Effect and drop to one Life Point instead. Any other Effects and damage are taken normally. A Final trap effect cannot be stopped by Trap Sense.
