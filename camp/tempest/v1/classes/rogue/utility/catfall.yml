description: |
    The Rogue gains the Agility Character Perk. In addition, the character may sacrifice a Life Point to Counter the damage and effects from one fall.

    **For Example**: Avana, climbing across a narrow ledge, slips and falls forty feet to the sharp rocks below, normally taking 10 damage and a Disable to both legs. Instead, they sacrifice one Life Point to call “Counter, Catfall” and negate the effects of the environmental damage from the fall.
