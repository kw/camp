description: |
    The Rogue can booby trap themself so that they are the only one who can access their equipment and pouches. The Rogue should spend a Slow Count of 120 preparing their pouches, pockets and garb with the trap. They may decide whether to build a mechanical or chemical trap at the time of creation.

    If the Rogue is searched before the next Long Rest, a mechanical trap will do 8 points of damage, while a chemical trap will do 12 points of Poison damage to the searcher. Either trap should be called as soon as someone starts a search of the Rogue (whether conscious or not).
