description: |
  While attempting a mundane lock, the character can call “Rogue’s Touch” if there is some negative effect to failing the lock, or failing to pick it in a certain amount of time. This will not Counter the negative effect, but will allow the character to try again from the beginning.

  So if the Rogue had to pick a lock within one minute or take a Death Effect, they could take the minute, and as soon as the fact that there was a consequence for failure announced, they could call “Rogue’s Touch” and take another minute. If they do not immediately re-start the attempt or if they totally disengage from the lock, the consequence occurs.

  At 10th level, the Rogue may do this twice on the same lock.
