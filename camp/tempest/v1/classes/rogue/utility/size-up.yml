description: |
    The Rogue has a practiced eye in finding “big fish” and can, with careful observation, tell a lot about how much wealth a person is carrying. They use various clues and all their senses to tell if someone is carrying more than [X] Wealth with them, where [X] is a number of their choice. They must observe the target carefully for a Focus Quick 100 before making the Call. This skill may only be used once per Short Rest on any given target.
