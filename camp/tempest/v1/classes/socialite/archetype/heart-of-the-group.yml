  Socialites tend to find themselves at the center of social cliques. Acting as the cog of a wheel can confer many benefits to its members, including organization, information disbursement, and even mental health.

  A Socialite may extend a formal invitation after spending 5-10 minutes discussing the group with the potential new member. Invitees must accept of their own free will, automatically resisting any compulsions to join.

  The new member gains the Inherent Qualifier: Member of [Group Name]. In addition, they gain effects from other Socialite powers targeting the group. However, they may leave at any time by informing the Socialite or by notifying Staff between games.

  The Socialite gains a number of "Counters" equal to their levels in Socialite usable against any attack or power from any member of their group.

  The Socialite must inform Staff when a group is created (before any recruiting happens), disbanded, and when a new member is inducted. Without powers or items to create an exception, the Socialite may have up to their Socialite level in members, and may only be the Heart of a single group. A Socialite's bodyguard, and the Socialite themselves, may be included in the group without counting against the total limit.
