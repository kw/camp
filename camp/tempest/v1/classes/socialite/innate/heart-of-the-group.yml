  Socialites tend to find themselves at the center of social cliques. Acting as the cog of a wheel can confer many benefits to its members, including organization, information disbursement, and even mental health.

  A Socialite may extend a formal invitation after spending 5-10 minutes discussing the group with the potential new member. Invitees must accept of their own free will, and this Power cannot be used if the Socialite knows the invited individual is compelled in any way.

  The new member gains the Inherent Type: Member of [Group Name] (the Socialite should feel free to name the group). A member may leave at any time by informing the Socialite or by notifying Staff between games. If the Socialite is asked about leaving, or informed that the member was under a compulsion when they accepted, the Socialite must volunteer information about leaving.

   The Socialite gains a number of "Counters" equal to their levels in Socialite usable against any attack or power from any member of their group.

  The Socialite must inform Staff when a group is created (before any recruiting happens), disbanded, and when a new member is inducted (immediacy is not necessary). Without Powers or items to create an exception, the Socialite may have up to their Socialite level in members, and may only be the Heart of a single group. A Socialite's bodyguard, and the Socialite themselves, may be included in the group without counting against the total limit.
