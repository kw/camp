description: |
  Social butterflies with bright garish colors make for excellent distractions, especially for the Bodyguard with a sharp, poisoned knife. By using this power, the Socialite may draw the attention, briefly, of an opponent while their Bodyguard sneaks in for the kill. This ability requires a roleplay of at least ten words audibly taunting the target.
