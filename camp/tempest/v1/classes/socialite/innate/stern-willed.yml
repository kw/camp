description: |
  The mind of a Socialite is known for its ability to keep its secrets and push past the lesser wills that would hinder it. The Socialite may call “Counter, Stern Will” to Counter a Berserk, Charm, or Dominate Effect used on them. Once the character has 10 levels of Socialite, they can also Counter the Obey Effect with this Power.
