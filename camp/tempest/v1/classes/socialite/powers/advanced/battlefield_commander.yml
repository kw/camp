description: |
  When pressed into combat, the Socialite is best able to serve while heavily guarded and calling the shots from the back. Their quick wit and observant nature are cornerstones of the Socialite’s battlefield prowess. Weaving inspiring words to benefit their allies is what they do best.

  The Socialite may use the following abilities to grant boons a number of times equal to their Socialite Class Level:

  * Short Grant +1 to Spike Damage
  * Mend 3 Armor
  * Heal 1
  * Grant Protect vs Packets
  * Grant Protect vs [Fear / Will]

  This power ends when the Socialite completes a Short Rest, or has given out a number of boons equal to their Socialite class-level.
