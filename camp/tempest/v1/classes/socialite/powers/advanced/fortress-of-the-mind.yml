description: |
  The Socialite can keep a certain part of their mind separate and inviolate. This part will watch over the character’s personality, even if that personality is suborned by enchantment magic. While under the effect of a condition using the Mind or Will accents, the character may at any time call “Dispel [Mind or Will] by Will”. This can be done even if the character has been ordered not to.
