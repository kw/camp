  By presenting a work of art, trinket, or performance, the Socialite can boost the energy and strength of some of the attendees.

  The chosen targets may Refresh one expended Novice spell-slot or Basic-tier Power, which must have a Refresh of Short Rest (or shorter, including none), after attending the entire presentation. The number of affected targets depends on the Socialite’s class-levels:

  * Less than 10: Four targets
  * 10-14: Six targets
  * 15-19: Eight targets
  * 20+: Ten targets

  Levels of the Ringleader Advanced Class count as Socialite Class Levels for the purposes of this power.

  The Socialite cannot benefit from their own Inspiring Performance.
