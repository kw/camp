description: |
  By presenting a work of art, trinket, or performance, the Socialite can boost the energy and strength of some of the attendees. The performance should be substantive and not a perfunctory show to enable the use of the power.

  Those who are in the Socialite’s audience get to Refresh a Novice Spell-Slot or Long Rest Basic Power. The Socialite cannot benefit from their own Inspiring Performance as they were not in the audience.
