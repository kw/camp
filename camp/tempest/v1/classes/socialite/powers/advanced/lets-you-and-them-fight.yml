description: |
  Socialites are quite adept at diverting the focus of their foes when the need arises. With a bit of flair, this can take the focus off the Socialite, and place it on someone else... more suitable to violence.

  The Socialite may, after being struck in melee combat, target their attacker and utter a quick diversionary phrase (ex, “Look over there!”), and then cause the target to seek vengeance elsewhere with a “[Name or Description] Quick Dominate.” The only command the Socialite may give the dominated foe is “Attack someone else!”
