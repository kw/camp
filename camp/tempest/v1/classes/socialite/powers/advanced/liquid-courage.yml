  As a master of poisons, the Socialite knows the best defense against their own tools.

  Having developed their own potent brew to counter toxic effects, the Socialite may line up a round of shots for up to 6 people. Each person who consumes the brew gains a Protect vs Will, Fear, and Poison by Poison as the liquid coats the inside of their stomach and sturdies their mind.
