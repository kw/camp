description: |
  The Socialite may pay 10 Wealth to Plot to place a Bounty of 20 Wealth on a named individual. Once the payment is accepted, the Socialite must post the individual’s name, likeness, and description in at least three conspicuous locations to make the Bounty active. If the Socialite is aware of posters being removed and does not replace them, the Protect (described below) and Bounty both end.

  The following effects are in play for the duration of the Bounty:

  * Characters with proof of the target’s death may collect the Bounty from Plot
  * The Socialite may call “Grant Protect vs Damage from [Target] to Self” each time they Short Rest, but may only have one bonus against a single target at any one time

  A Socialite with Mark for Death may pay 5 Wealth to Plot to add 10 to a Bounty on a poster, other than their own, without expending their power.
