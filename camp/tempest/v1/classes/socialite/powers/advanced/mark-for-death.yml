  The Socialite may place a contract on a named individual by going to the Plot Staff and paying a bounty of 25 Wealth to make a 50 Wealth bounty (Staff will provide the other 25). This bounty will be held in escrow by Plot Staff, and may be added to by characters and NPCs as outlined below.

  Until the end of the Event, any character who knows about the bounty may provide proof to the Plot Staff of the death of the target, and collect the bounty.


  * The Socialite may call “Counter, Death Mark” if they are attacked (damage or Effects) by the bounty’s target. They can do this once per Short Rest.

  For this bounty to be active, the Socialite must post the individual’s name, likeness, and description in at least three conspicuous locations, as well as giving instructions for collecting the bounty and the requirement for proof. If members of Staff notice that the posters have been gone for a reasonable amount of time without being replaced, they can decide to cancel the bounty, and the Socialite may return to Staff to collect the original ante’d wealth.

  Another Socialite with Mark for Death may pay 5 Wealth to add an additional 10 to a Bounty other than their own, without expending their power by visiting Plot and naming the specific Bounty they wish to add their name to. However, they must also conspicuously add their name to each of the three posters of the original Bounty before doing so.
