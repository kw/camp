description: |
  Nobody wants to stomp the flowers… usually. The Socialite is adept at convincing combatants in a bar fight or a theater of war that there are bigger fish to fry. While not brandishing any Melee weapons, the Socialite may Call “[Name or Description] Short Repel by Will” to a creature who they believe is about to attack them.
