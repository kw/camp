description: |
  Peacebind encourages a safe location. It cannot shut down all attacks, but it does give some measure of security.

  Peacebind can only be used on a Helpless or Willing target because it is a Touch Power, and occasionally situations will make it clear Peacebinding is a requirement to enter a specific meeting or area. The wording of the Call can be adjusted from “building” to “tent”, “structure”, “corral”, etc. for clarity, so long as it is a contained area with obviously marked physical borders.
