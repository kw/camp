  The Socialite must start by grabbing the target’s attention. Then the Call is made, Curing the Condition, and the Socialite must try to spend another ten seconds or so speaking in a calm, soothing tone, trying to help the target find themself again.

  Alternatively, out of combat, this Power can be used after talking soothingly to the target for a minute or so (and explaining the effects of the Power), to cure the negative effects of the Nightmare Challenge.
