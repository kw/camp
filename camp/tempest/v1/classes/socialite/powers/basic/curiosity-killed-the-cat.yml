description: |
  The Socialite can booby trap a personal container, but can only have one trapped container at a time. Over a Slow 120 the character roleplays setting up the device and decides whether it is a mechanical or chemical trap. The trap is considered active and must be disabled normally if the container is searched before the next Long Rest. The trap is automatically disarmed if the Socialite opens the container or at a Long Rest.

  A triggered trap will make a snap and deal 4 (mechanical) or 6 (chemical) damage to the searcher. Chemical traps will also destroy all flammable objects in the container. Like the Tinkering Power “Triggered Base Trap”, the trap is represented by a mousetrap, party popper, and/or snaps.
