description: |
  A group trusts their Heart and can be emboldened by their words. The Heart may speak to each individual in their Heart-group once per Long Rest and give them a special boon. Each individual can only be given the boon once per Long Rest. The Socialite may choose from the following three options:

  - “Imbue Weapon with Wounding 3, and Refresh one Basic or Advanced Long Rest Power”
  - “Imbue Packet with Wounding 5, and Refresh one Novice or Adept Spell-Slot.”
  - “Grant 3 Barrier”

    The accompanying roleplay must be a suitably motivating activity such as a rousing speech, back and forth discussion of battle tactics, a sermon, an assurance of purpose, a hug (remember physical consent rules), or a heart to heart where the Socialite gushes about how much the person means to them.
