  The Socialite has an intoxicating effect on those around them. After performing for an audience, the Socialite may gather their will and lull the audience into an intoxicated state. The roleplay of that state is up to the affected, and may be ended at any time. The call should be just loud enough to cover those who were paying attention to the performance, and no louder.
