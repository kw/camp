description: |
  Thin lace gloves do very little to protect against exposure to the poisons sprinkled into drinks and foodstuffs. To one end, this exposure can be quite deadly, but some Socialites have acquired a taste for the almondy brush of death. The Socialite may gain a Protect vs. Poison by Poison when applying toxin to a weapon, or a Protect vs Ingested Poison by Poison when applying it to food/drink.
