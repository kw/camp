  Even the wittiest interrogator will be dazzled by a Socialite’s confident words… if only for a short while.

  It’s not about outrunning the bear, it’s about outrunning your friend who’s slower than you. Socialites have mastered the tactic of getting out when the coins are down. After explaining they could not have possibly done the thing (that they likely did) for at least 10 seconds, and providing a somewhat believable excuse (“Couldn't have been me, I was blind that day. Eyes got eaten by birds. It was the one armed man!”), the Socialite may force their victims to believe their lie long enough for them to escape unharmed.
