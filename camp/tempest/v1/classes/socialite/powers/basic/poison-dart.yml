description: |
  The only difference between murder and an assassination is the intended target and their perceived importance. When timelines get short, Socialites sometimes find they cannot simply hire it out and need to do things themselves… even though their preferred subtleties might not be applicable.

  Poison Darts in the form of thrown weapons do not require the Thrown Weapons Skill to prepare or throw.

  This Power can only be prepared outside of combat on a Packet or Thrown Weapon. Once the dart is prepared, it will remain “charged” until it is put down or thrown, or until the Socialite completes a Rest.
