description: |
  Sticks and stones may break bones, but words can still hurt. The Socialite has learned to weave insults to make even the most stoic enraged. By spending a Spike, the Socialite may call “Quick Berserk by Will.” If the materia is completely red, this power refreshes on a Short Rest. If it is any other color, it refreshes on a Long Rest.
