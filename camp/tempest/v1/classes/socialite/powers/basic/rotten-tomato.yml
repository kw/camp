  Sticks and stones may break bones, but words still hurt my feelings.

  The Socialite has learned to weave insults to make even the most stoic enraged. By spending a Spike, the Socialite may call “Quick Berserk by Will.” If the materia is completely red (or looks like a tomato), this Power refreshes on a Short Rest, otherwise it refreshes on a Long Rest. Note that the insult is the Incantation, so the character’s foot must be planted, one hand free, etc. just like a normal Incantation.
