  “Our waitress is left-handed and the Drimmen sitting up at the counter weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself.”

  Socialites rely on their wit and observation to survive, and have learned to uncover threats. Once an opponent has been identified they can be negotiated with.

  Socialites may ask one of the below questions once per Individual per Short Rest after the Focus is completed:

  * Do you intend to harm us?
  * Are you willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution?
  * Will you accept a bribe?
