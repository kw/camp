  A Heart may engage a member of their group in a long conversation for about 5 minutes, after which they may inquire into their wellbeing and determine how to be a supportive force in their life. The target must engage with the Socialite, otherwise they may not be Discerned, otherwise they may be asked all of the questions below:

  * "Are you under the effects of any Charm, Dominate, or Obey effects, if so which ones?"
  * “Have you lied to me in the last five minutes?”
  * "Is this your true form?"
  * “Are you under the effects of any curses, if so which ones?"
  * “How are you feeling generally?"
  * "Is there anything you wish you could tell me about, but haven't out of fear, social pressure, or desire to not be a burden to me, If so what is it?”

  The Socialite may choose to either Heal the target for 5 or Cure a Conditions on the target at the conclusion of their talk.
