  Getting stabbed is usually fairly low on a Socialite’s agenda, and magical bonds yanking at their heels typically only help those trying to stab them.

  The Socialite may twist their will to end a Slow, Root, or Disable condition on a target. If this power targets the Socialite’s Bodyguard the Delivery may be Verbal and the Socialite also receives the same Cure (use the same call).
