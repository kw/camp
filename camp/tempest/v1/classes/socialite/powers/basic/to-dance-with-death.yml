description: |
  Dancing can be such an intimate time, so many opportunities to subtly betray one so close. The Socialite is not one to sleep on such an opportunity.

  After dancing for at least a full minute, the Socialite may conclude the dance by calling “[Name or Description] Piercing [X] by Poison, Short Taint by Poison,” where X is equal to the character’s levels in Socialite. This power cannot be used in combat, must be used on their most recent dance partner, and that character must have engaged you in dance back. Remember to get consent before touching other players.
