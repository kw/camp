  Whether walking the lines before a battle, delving into a dungeon, or starting off a council meeting, Socialites know how to inspire allies.

  The Socialite should give a speech lasting at least two minutes. It may include tactical or strategic information, but it must also attempt to inspire and motivate. This speech is an Incantation, so the Socialite cannot move their foot, must have one hand free, and cannot be disturbed while giving it (or else begin again). Once that rousing speech is completed, the Socialite can inspire individuals who listened to the speech. For each individual who the Socialite believes was motivated by the speech, the Socialite can give them a few individual words of encouragement, and give one of the following boons by Touch:


  * “Short Grant 1 Bonus Maximum Spike”
  * “Short Grant 5 Barrier by Will”
  * “Grant Protect vs Packets by Will”

  The Socialite may give themself any or all of these boons upon completion of the speech.
