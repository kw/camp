  Whether walking the lines before a battle, delving into a dungeon, or starting off a council meeting, Socialites know how to inspire allies.

  The Socialite gains charges equal to their Socialite class level after inspiring their allies with rousing words of victory for a couple minutes. By spending about 15 seconds roleplaying encouraging an ally, the Socialite may spend a charge to do one of the following:

  * “[Name or Description] Grant 1 Spike by Will”
  * “[Name or Description] Grant 3 Barrier by Will”
  * “[Name or Description] Grant Protect vs Fear by Will”

  Unspent charges will expire after a Short Rest, or if the Socialite becomes Helpless.
