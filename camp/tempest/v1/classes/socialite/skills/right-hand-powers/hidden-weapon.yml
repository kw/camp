description: |
  Bodyguards aren’t particularly useful if they cannot defend the Socialite. The pair are used to taking advantage of the Socialite’s quick diversions to sneak weapons into places they are normally forbidden. To use this Power, the Socialite must give the Bodyguard a brightly colored cloth to attach or tie to a weapon. At this time, the Power should be explained to the Bodyguard.
