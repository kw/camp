  Socialites don’t make a habit of wandering around on their own, and seeing to their Bodyguard’s safety is mutually beneficial. Once per Short Rest the Socialite may bolster a Bodyguard. The Socialite grants a Protect vs. Damage. The Socialite may not give this Protect to the same Bodyguard more than once per Long Rest.
