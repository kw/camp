description: |
  After a brief inspection of the Bodyguard’s materia, and an explanation of this Power, the Socialite becomes able to hold charged Packets (of either kind) that their Bodyguard has cast. The Socialite and the Bodyguard can pass Packets back and forth without them being discharged. The Socialite cannot use the Packets, only hold them. Packets held by the Socialite will not discharge or lose their charge if the Bodyguard casts other Spells. The Socialite is subject to all the rules for holding the Packet, but once the Socialite completes a Short Rest and this Power ends, any Packets still being held will also become inert. When the Packet is passed back and forth, the two should remind each other of the Call held within the Packet.

  **For Example:** *Trobriand is the Bodyguard for Jheshyra, who has activated Third Hand. Trobriand, an Artificer, creates a charged Packet with Acid-Soak. He hands it to Jheshyra and says “Reminder: Wounding 8 by Acid”. He then does some other things, including creating other Packets and throwing them, before asking for the Packet back. Jheshyra hands him the Spell-Ball and says “Reminder: Wounding 8 by Acid”.*
