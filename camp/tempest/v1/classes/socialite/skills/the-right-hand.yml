  The Socialite is a creature of beauty, a flower in a field, and a damsel in distress… when they want to be. Otherwise they have a Bodyguard.

  After a detailed conversation and a written contract, a Socialite may bind their target into an agreement to protect them from harm. This contract is valid for at least a Long Rest, but may be extended automatically and indefinitely.

  Bodyguarding is serious work. An individual may only act as a Bodyguard for one person at a time, and Socialites may only retain one Bodyguard at a time.

  Socialites with The Right Hand may select one power from the Right Hand Powers list, plus an additional for every three Socialite class levels after the first. Listed CP costs must be paid.

  **For Example**: _Jabberwock takes The Right Hand at Socialite level 2. He immediately gains one class power for which he meets the prerequisites and which has Requirement: The Right Hand. When Jabberwock takes his 4th level in Socialite, he will pick an additional class power for which he meets the requirements and which has Requirement: The Right Hand. This is true for level 7, 10, 13, etc._
