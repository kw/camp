  The Socialite is a creature of beauty, a flower in a field. They’re a damsel in distress when they want to be, and when they don’t want to be, they have their Bodyguard. After talking with another individual at length about becoming the Socialite’s bodyguard, they may bind that individual into a written contract stating that they will protect the Socialite should they fall in harm’s way. This contract is valid until stated otherwise (it defaults to a Long Rest, but may be extended indefinitely with subsequent uses of this ability).

  Only one individual may be the Socialite’s bodyguard at a time, and an individual may only Bodyguard for one Socialite at any time.

  Upon selecting The Right Hand, you may take up to one Class power from the [Right Hand] Powers list. For every three class-levels after the first in Socialite, the Socialite may choose an additional Class Power from the [Right Hand] Powers list. These are in addition to their normal powers. Some of these powers have a cost of CP which must still be paid.

  For Example: Jabberwock takes The Right Hand at Socialite level 2. He immediately gains one class power for which he meets the prerequisites and which has Requirement: The Right Hand. When Jabberwock takes his 4th level in Socialite, he will pick an additional class power for which he meets the requirements and which has Requirement: The Right Hand. This is true for level 7, 10, 13, etc.
