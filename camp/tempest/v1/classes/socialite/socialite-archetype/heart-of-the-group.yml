description: |
The Socialite may spend significant time, generally 5-10 minutes, discussing their group to a character and at the end of the discussion induct that character into the group. The character must accept the invitation of their own free will and cannot be compelled into joining.

Upon joining the group the character gains the Inherent Type: Member of [Group Name]. The character may leave the group at any time by informing the Socialite or between games by informing staff that they wish to leave the group. Each Event the Socialite may call '"Counter"' to any attack or power used on the Socialite from any member of the group once per level of Socialite they possess. Joining the group also has other effects detailed in other Socialite powers below.

The Socialite must inform staff they have created a group before inducting any members. To disband a group, the Socialite must inform staff between games. The Socialite may only have a number of characters as a part of their group equal to their Socialite level. Socialites may only be the Heart of a single group without other powers or items. Characters added to a group in this manner should be logged with staff.

If the Socialite has a bodyguard, that character may be included in the group without counting against the total limit. The Socialite may also include themselves in their own group without counting against the total limit.
