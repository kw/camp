Across the lands, the Socialite is well versed in appearing hospitable, but always with an escape plan or hidden agenda. Among the most feared and lethal tools at their disposal is the wide array of poisons easily procured in even the most out-of-the-way locations. Beware a proffered drink from a Socialite, as that sickly sweet taste might be your last.

All ingested poisons the Socialite places into drinks are modified to add the '“Final”' tag.

Additionally, once per Event, the Socialite may poison a drink with '“Heal to Full and Cure all Conditions by Poison Final”'
