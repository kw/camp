description: |
The Socialite must raise their hands in the air, palms open, with nothing held in either hand other than a white flag (not required, but allowed). As long as their hands are visible, and not holding anything other than the white flag, and does not move their feet, they may remain Insubstantial. The character cannot benefit from Rests while this Power is active.
