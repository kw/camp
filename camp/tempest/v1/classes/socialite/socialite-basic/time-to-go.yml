Getting stabbed is usually fairly low on a Socialite’s agenda for things they want to do on a given night, and when magical bonds are yanking at their heels, then it’s usually time to not be around what’s attempting to stab you. The Socialite may twist their will to end a Slow, Root, or Disable condition on a target.

If this power targets the Socialite’s Bodyguard the delivery may be Verbal and the Socialite also receives the same Cure (use the same call).
