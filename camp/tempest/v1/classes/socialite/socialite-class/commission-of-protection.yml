description: |
Out of Combat, the Socialite can present the Bodyguard with their favor: a trinket, token, necklace, or similar adornment.

While the Bodyguard visibility wears the token, the Socialite may, at-will, Grant One Barrier to the Bodyguard if their Bodyguard doesn’t already have a Barrier.
