Often before battle, the Socialite is seen making rounds inspiring and rousing their allies’ morale. Once per Event, the Socialite can spend a Slow 100 inspiring their allies with rousing words of victory. Once their allies are suitably inspired, they gain a number of charges equal to their Socialite class-level. These charges will last until the Socialite is dropped to Dying or takes a Short Rest, whichever comes first. By spending a Quick 100 roleplaying encouraging an ally, the Socialite may spend a charge to do one of the following:

'“[Name or Description] Grant 1 Spike by Will”'
'“[Name or Description] Grant 3 Barrier by Will”'
'“[Name or Description] Grant Protect vs Fear by Will”'
