  The Socialite bestows a few words of encouragement and some tips on how to improve the quality during a Crafter’s process. The Crafter (who cannot be the Socialite) is able to improve their Plan with a minor boon from the list below. Each ability can only be used once per craft, and the effect only lasts til the end of the Event. As part of the RP, the exact benefit and its duration must be explained.


  * Ritual/Enchantment: As a Participant, add or remove one Dark Territory
  * Weapon:  +1 Bonus Spike Damage to one attack per Short Rest. Ability is lost if the weapon changes hands
  * Armor/Shield: The wielder may call “Resist Shatter” once
  * Trap/Damage Dealing Alchemy: The damage of the item(s) is doubled
  * Healing: The healing effect of the crafted item is increased by +3
