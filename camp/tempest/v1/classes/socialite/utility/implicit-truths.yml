  By book education or more practical means, the Socialite is familiar with the ways of many puzzles.

  The Socialite gains the Insight Perk.

  In addition, whenever the Socialite uses Insight, they can ask these two specific additional questions of a nearby Lantern Spirit:

  * “Is there a timer that resets their work, time limit on the puzzle, or other practical timed aspect to the situation?”
  * “Is an action they are about to take likely to end disastrously?”
