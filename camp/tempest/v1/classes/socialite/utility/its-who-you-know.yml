  When people are your business, you learn the tell-tale signs of who is dealing in what. In this case, you know someone who specializes in moving goods with questionable sources.

  The Socialite may exchange Basic or Uncommon Resources with their off-stage business contacts for a small fee. They send up to 15 Basic (Hide/Ingot/Bloom) or 7 Uncommon (Rare Minerals/Harvest/Night Prizes) and 2 Wealth (their fee) and get an equal number of the same rank (Basic/Uncommon) in a denomination of the Socialite’s choice.

  Players pass the Resources and Wealth to Staff with a note detailing their return request. Staff will make the trades return to the Socialite at their convenience. The Resources and Wealth will be refunded and the ability refreshed if Staff cannot make the trade for logistical or plot reasons.
