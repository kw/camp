  The Socialite gains 2 Wealth per Event at Logistics check-in.

  Additionally, the Socialite can serve as an intermediary between two combatants who wish to beat each other to a pulp. The Socialite declares the fight and ensures everyone knows the rules. Once the two duelists accept the duel, the Pit Master has a few Instructions to give. This need not be verbatim:

  “Instruction to [Names of Duelists]: You will be unable to use Powers or make attacks on anyone but each other until this duel ends. The duel ends when I declare a winner, when one of you takes damage or an Effect from someone not in this duel, or one of you admit defeat to the other. When the duel ends, you will have all the same Powers, Life Points, and Armor Points you have right now, regardless of what is used during the duel; only expended Resources will remain expended.”

  The duel is declared by the Socialite with the following calls at thematically appropriate moments:

  * “I declare this duel honorable and just!”
  * “Duelists, are you ready?”
  * “Fight!”
  * “Winner!”

  If the Socialite knows that the duel has ended, they must inform the duelists.
