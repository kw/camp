  The Socialite gains 2 wealth per Event at check-in.

  To declare the duel the Socialite calls the following at thematically appropriate moments:  “I declare this duel honorable and just!”, “Duelists, are you ready?”, “Fight!”, “Winner!”

  Additionally, the Socialite can serve as an intermediary between two combatants who wish to beat each other to a pulp. The Socialite declares the fight and ensures everyone knows the rules. At the moment the Socialite declares the fight, the participants should take stock of their abilities. When the fight concludes and a winner is declared by the Socialite, the Socialite may refresh all the abilities the winner used during the fight.

  Upon use of this power, the Socialite may take stock of the powers and abilities of two willing combatants and allow them to engage in a mediated fight. Once the two duelists accept the duel, they gain the Short Inherent Taunt 1 condition to each other.

  If the duel is interrupted for any reason, including any combatant leaving the Duel area, it immediately ends.

  Once the duel is concluded, the Socialite must Call ”Instruction: Return to your state when the duel began.”
