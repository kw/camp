  With a few favors called the Socialite can add an additional stop to a merchant’s route. Correspondence must be sent in advance to give time for the merchant to adjust their travels accordingly.

  The Socialite must write the request before the end of an Event to arrange for the stop at the next Event. The letter must contain one request from the following list: General Goods, Ritual Supplies, Tinker Supplies, Alchemical Supplies, Enchanting Supplies, Raw Materials, and Specialty Goods.

  The merchant will arrive at the following Event and seek out a common place of commerce, offering the Socialite who called them right of first refusal on the first round of sales. If, for whatever reason, the merchant is unable to show, the Socialite may exercise their opportunity to make purchases at Check-In by themselves.

  Finally, the Traveling Merchant may be commissioned to sell goods on behalf of the Socialite as a consignment sale, negotiated at the time the Merchant arrives in town. The Socialite should be aware that particularly good sales by the merchant might incline them to tip the Socialite, but that’s up to individual roleplay.
