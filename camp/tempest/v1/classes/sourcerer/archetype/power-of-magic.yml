description: 
| The Sourcererâ€™s channeling of magic through the Eldritch Source allows them to make sacrifices other more traditional arcane casters cannot.
| 
| During any Long Rest, the Sourcerer may Sacrifice a Cantrip that they know, other than Cancel, losing the ability to cast it, until their next Long Rest. In exchange, the Sourcerer gains +1 Spike Damage, until their next Long Rest.
| 
| This Spike Damage Bonus only applies to Spells from the Sourcerer Spell list and cannot be applied to any other usage of Spikes.
| 
| In all cases, the normal stacking rules apply to these Spike Damage bonuses.
