description: |
  This minor cantrip takes the power out of a spell-ball (or multiple spell-balls) that has already been charged and returns that power to the caster. The spell-ball becomes inert, and the caster refreshes the spell-slot that was used to charge the spell-ball. If the spell charges more than one spell-ball, all the spell-balls must still be charged in order to cancel the spell.
