description: |
  The Sourcerer calls forth a ring of elemental power that wreaths their hand in visible crackling energy. The caster charges four Spell-Packets, one with each of the four elemental Accents (Acid/Flame/Ice/Lightning). These can be thrown in any order.

  If the Sourcerer expends a Spike when throwing a charged Spell-Packet from this Cantrip, the Call is changed to “Wounding 2 by [Whichever Element is being Thrown]” for that charged Spell-Packet.
