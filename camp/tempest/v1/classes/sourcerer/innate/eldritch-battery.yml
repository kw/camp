description: |
  The Sourcerer can meditate and commune with the Weave to rebuild focus and refresh their Arcane Spell-slots. The Sourcerer can spend a Short Rest communing with Eldritch forces, contemplating their Source, or practicing their incantations quietly.

  The Sourcerer can perform this special study and refresh all of their expended Arcane spell-slots. If the Sourcerer has used any other Innate Power from another class to refresh their Arcane spell slots this long rest they may not use Eldritch Battery.

  Alternatively, if the Sourcerer studies in an area of powerful arcane magic (such as an Arcane Locus), and performs a personal rite (determined by the Sourcerer ), the Sourcerer gains three additional Novice-tier Spell-Slots. These Spell-Slots last until the Sourcerer completes a Long Rest. Additional benefits may be possible (see the Character Options chapter for more details).

  Finally, if the Sourcerer has not worn physical armor at any point prior to the use of this Power this event they may once per Event refresh Eldritch Battery immediately. In doing so they lose the ability to wear physical armor for the remainder of the Event.
