  The Sourcerer has an item (See Eldritch Source, above) that is special to them. The character may begin with an object of their choice empowered as a Source. Eldritch Sources must be a solid durable object at least 5” in one dimension and 1” in the others.

  After completing a Long Rest, a Sourcerer may empower a new object as their Source (the other one loses its Source properties). This Source must follow all rules defining an appropriate object. If that object is not an Empowered Source, it is attuned to one of the following Accents: Acid, Ice, Flame, or Lightning, chosen at the time of designation as a Source. The Sorcerer may only have one Source at any one time, and this Source will only work for the Sourcerer who designated it.

  However, the Source comes with some risk: should the Sourcerer find themself without an Eldritch Source, they will lose access to all Sourcerer Spell-Slots and Known Spells until the Eldritch Source is back in hand or a new object is designated (at a Long Rest, see above). Once per Short Rest, the Sourcerer may rebuild a broken or shattered Eldritch Source by performing a personal rite over the Source. If it was Shattered, the Source must first be Mended.

  Once the Sourcerer has reached 10th Sourcerer level and again at 15th Sourcerer level, when empowering an Eldritch Source, the Sourcerer may choose an additional Eldritch Accent for the Source. While wielding the enhanced Source, the caster may use either Accent when the [Eldritch Accent] is noted. When choosing this Eldritch Accent for a given Power, all instances of the [Eldritch Accent] must be the same Accent.

  **Note**: The Sourcerer’s Eldritch Source takes the place of the Basic Arcane Spellbook. The Sourcerer cannot use Powers or Skills that rely on a Spellbook for their Sourcerer Spells.
