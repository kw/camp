description: |
  The Sourcererâ€™s channeling of magic through the Eldritch Source allows them to make sacrifices other more traditional arcane casters cannot.

  Upon completion of a Long Rest, the Sourcerer may Sacrifice a Cantrip that they know, other than Cancel, losing the ability to cast it until their next Long Rest.  In exchange, the Sourceror may select an accent they have a Source for and add +1 damage to any spell cast with that accent, for a Long Rest.
