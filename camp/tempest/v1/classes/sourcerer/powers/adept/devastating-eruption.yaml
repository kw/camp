  After finishing the Call for this Spell, the Sourcerer must hold up their Source with both hands. After a Focus Quick 100 of role-playing unraveling the arcane energies stored within it, the Sourcerer may overload the source, destroying it and calling “By My Voice, 4 by [Eldritch Accent].” The Sourcerer takes the damage as Final. This Spell’s effects cannot be altered other than as listed in this Spell’s description.

  Enhancement: Expend up to four Spikes: Increase the damage of this Spell by two per Spike expended.
  Enhancement: Greater Spell-Slot: The Piercing Effect is added to the damage.

  **Note**: The Source is irrevocably destroyed in the process of casting this spell, and should be turned into the Ash Bin as soon as possible. It may not be Rebuilt.
