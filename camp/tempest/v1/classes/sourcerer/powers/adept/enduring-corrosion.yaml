  The Sourcerer casts an orb of acidic material at a foe, and then feeds the reaction with energy from their source ensuring it will burn away at their enemy forever.

  If the initial attack” isn't Prevented, the Sourcerer may then Focus Quick 30 and call “[Name or Description] 1 Acid” against the target they just hit. They may continue to call these Verbal attacks until the Sourcerer uses another Power, takes damage or an Effect, or completes a Rest, at which point the Spell ends.

  Enhancement: If the Sourcerer’s [Eldritch Accent] is Acid, they may instead call “[Name or Description] 2 Acid” on the subsequent Verbal attacks.
