description:
   Until the Sorcerer completes a Short Rest, the Sourcerer may at-will roleplay setting a particular materia alight for a Focus Quick 30 and then add their Spike Damage Bonus to the next damaging Spell-Packet (not Spell-Ball) they throw. Only Spell-Packets that will cause Flame-Accented damage will gain this damage bonus.
