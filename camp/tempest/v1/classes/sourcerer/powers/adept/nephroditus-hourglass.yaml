description: |
  When this Spell is cast, the Sourcerer places themselves in a protective shell and is forcibly shifted forward in time. The Sourcerer is immediately imprisoned and should Call “Short Imprison by Time to Self”. They may, while imprisoned, Focus for a Slow Count of 60 to Call “Grant Short Rest.” The Sourcerer must then call “Cure Imprisoned” to come out of the time-cocoon. The Sourcerer may cast this Spell only once per Long Rest.
