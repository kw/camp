  The Sourcerer can summon ash into the very lungs of their foes. When this spell is cast, Smothering Ash charges two Spell-Balls with Wounding 6 Flame. As long as the first attack does not miss, the Sourcerer may choose to throw the second Spell-Ball with the Call “Short Silence by Flame,” instead of “Wounding 6 by Flame”.
