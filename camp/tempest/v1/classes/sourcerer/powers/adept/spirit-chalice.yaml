description: |
  Until the end of the Sourcerer’s next Short Rest, they have the ability to use the death of others to power their magic. For the duration, the Sourcerer can touch a creature who is Helpless and cause it to die. The call for this death-touch is “Death to Helpless by [Eldritch Accent].” If this is not Prevented, the Sourcerer may Refresh one Spike. This can be done as often as desired during the duration of the spell.

  **Note**: This is a Touch Spell and thus can only be used on the Helpless. It may be necessary to let the player/portrayer of the target know that they are being targeted by a Touch Spell if their eyes are closed or they are otherwise insensible.
