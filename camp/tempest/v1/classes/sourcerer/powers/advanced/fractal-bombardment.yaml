name: Fractal Bombardment
incant: "... to unleash raw power."
call: “Short Imbue Fractal Bombardment”
target: Self
delivery: None
accent: None
duration: Short Rest, Special
refresh: Spell
effect: Imbue
description: |
  The Sourcerer creates a tear in reality through which pure power can flow through at increasing rates.

  While this enhancement lasts, the Sourcer gains the Fractal Spike power below:
subcard:
  name: Fractal Spike
  incant: '“I call forth a fractal spike.”'
  call: '[X] [Eldritch Accent]'
  target: Individuals
  delivery: Packet (Spell-Ball)
  accent: '[Eldritch Accent]'
  duration: Special
  refresh: Immediate
  effect: None, only damage
  description: |
    The Sourcerer may charge a spell-ball with "1 [Eldritch Accent]."

    If the attack does not miss and is not Blocked or Prevented, this power immediately refreshes, and the damage of the call increases by one. (Ex: “2 [Eldritch Accent]” for the second spell ball, “3 [Eldritch Accent]” for the third spell ball, and so on.)

    The Sourcerer may never charge a spell-ball for more than their Maximum Spike Damage. Once they reach this limit the Sourcerer may continue to charge Spell-balls at that value until Fractal Bombardment ends.

    The Sourcerer may repeat this process until the Sourcerer casts another spell, takes a Short Rest, the caster becomes unable to use Powers, a spell-ball misses, or a spell-ball is Prevented, at which time any charged Fractal Spike loses its power, and Fractal Bombardment ends.
