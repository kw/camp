  When this spell is cast, the Sourcerer places themselves in a protective shell and is forcibly shifted forward in time, completing a Short Rest calling “Short Imprison to Self by Time.” The Sourcerer must then complete a Focus Slow 60 at the end of that focus, they must call “Grant Short Rest.” The Sourcerer may cast this spell once per Long Rest.
