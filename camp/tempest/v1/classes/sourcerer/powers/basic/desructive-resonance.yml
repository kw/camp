#The Sourcerer is able to set up deadly resonances within a helpless or willing target causing the victim to literally shake apart under the ever increasing vibrations. At-will, the caster may call “Piercing 1 to Helpless by [Eldritch Accent].” In addition, they may add the “to Insubstantial” or “to Imprisoned” qualifiers to this power.
