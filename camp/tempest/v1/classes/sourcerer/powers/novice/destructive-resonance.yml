description:
   For the duration of this Spell, the Sourcerer is able to set up deadly resonances within a helpless or willing target by Touch, causing the victim to literally shake apart under the ever increasing vibrations. The caster may call “Piercing 1 to Helpless by [Eldritch Accent]” and can then repeat that after Focusing for a Quick Count of 30. In addition, they may add the “to Insubstantial” or “to Imprisoned” qualifiers to this Spell as desired.
