   While this spell is active, when the Sourcerer strikes a target with a Spell-Packet from a Cantrip with the Acid Accent, they may immediately call “[Name or Description] Shield-Breaking by Acid” against that same target.

   This Spell ends when the caster completes a Short Rest, moves their right foot, becomes unable to use Powers, or is reduced to zero Life Points.
