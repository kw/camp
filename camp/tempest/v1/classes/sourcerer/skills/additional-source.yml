description: 
| The Sourcerer has mastered the arts of Source manipulation such that they may have an additional Eldritch Source bound.
| 
| After finishing a Short Rest linked to an object, the Sourcerer may designate a new item to become their Source in addition to their first. If that item is not an Empowered Source, you must choose one of the following Accents: Acid, Lighting, Flame or Ice.
| 
| While a character must hold an Eldritch Source in their hand to use its Accent, the character may switch between two different Eldritch Sources that they are bound to by Focusing for a Quick Count of 100.
