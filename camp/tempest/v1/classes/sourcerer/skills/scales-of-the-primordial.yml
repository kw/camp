description: 
| The Sourcerer can wave arcane scales into the air to protect them from harm. When taking a Short Rest they may grant themselves 2 Barrier by calling “Grant 2 Barrier to Self.” Gathering the mental fortitude is a rather lengthy process, but none-the-less the result will turn most blades, and can mean the difference between life and death.
