description: |
  The caster need not stop casting or restart their Sourcerer Spells when being struck or hit with Effects during Incantations. They should call “Concentration” at the completion of their Incantation, along with any relevant defenses.

   Note that while this Power affects Incantations, it does not stop non-Incantation Focus requirements such as for Refresh or the cooldown time on various Spells.
