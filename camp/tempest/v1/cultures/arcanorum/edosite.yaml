  _Concepts: Proud, Risk-Taking, Emotional_

  Edos, once the primary spanning empire of the known world, has fallen on hard times, and the attitudes of the people reflect that: A sense of “golden age lost” pervades the once proud people. This urge to reclaim lost glory is a bit of a two sided coin: The Edosite wears their heart on their sleeve, and both failure and success can lead to emotional runaways, though they are as often here in a flash, gone without a trace.

  Failure can be met with an almost fatalistic moroseness, and victory with a bombastic sense of inevitability. While the former is troublesome, the latter can be truly dangerous, as an Edosite on a winning streak can often believe themselves incapable of failure, taking greater and greater risks. Perhaps, however, this is not quite the drawback one might perceive, as the Edosite is never stuck in indecision, and almost certainly the adage “strike while the iron is hot” was forged there.

  ## Commonalities of the Culture

  * Some would say that even if gambling wasn’t invented in Edos, it was perfected there. Few Edosites would pass up a game of chance for the opportunity to win big, and Edosite parties are rife with raffles, games of chance and skill, and gambling of all stripes.
  * Hailing from once-proud imperial wealth, many Edosites regularly dress in what other cultures might consider their “best” as a matter of habit. Fine cloth, highly detailed embroidery, and freshly pressed garb is the hallmark of the Edosite at a social gathering.
  * Personal grooming is also a facet of Edosite culture, as any opportunity to show off is regularly taken. Intricate shaving patterns, jewel studded piercings, and colorful tattoos are just some of the lengths Edosites will go to stand out.
  * Edosites are notable tippers in their culture, prone to a subtle language of coin that some other cultures might perceive as graft or outright bribery. A coin passed in confidence is common when receiving a boon from another, and the winnings from a hot night gambling is commonly spread to those who cheered them on.
  * Edosite culture, being who they are, are no stranger to verbal tales of deals with the deities and demons of the world gone horribly wrong. So, while normally impulsive, Edosites are generally reluctant to engage in deals they don’t know the full scope of, often referring to tales of distant (and probably fictional) relatives who were burned, usually metaphorically, but not always.

  When thinking of the glory days of Edos it brings happiness to most Edosite’s but the treason of the Brassic people brings a deep seated anger as that was at the core of the fall of their empire. With these heavy emotions they can fuel themselves to push further and prove that the Edosite’s are not to be trifled with. After spending some time talking of the glory days and the betrayal of the Brassic they may embolden others that feel the story with “Short Strengthen by Will” To themselves and one other person.

  **Note**: This power can’t be done alone, at least one other individual must be present for the telling of the tale.
