  _Locations: Grimoire: Fenris Isle_

  _Concepts: Community, Honor, Noble Houses_

  Fenris is a Kingdom, run by three houses, built upon the corpse of Kerberos, the corpse of a three headed silver canine titan that became a mountain within a caldera after its death. The three major houses that make up the council running Fenris run a different aspect of the city, the commerce is handled by House Coinin, the white wolf head, the Industry is handled by House Ylva, the black wolf head and the military is handled by House Strongarm, the gray wolf head. The emblem of Fenris depicts the three wolf heads with the White wolf on the left and black wolf on the right and the gray wolf in the middle.

  The caldera is bordered by a massive wall built to protect its denizens from invasion and provides a barrier between Leonholdt and Naveshka. Due to Fenris being a neutral party, only having a mutual agreement with sunwatch, it makes it very difficult for the two warring nations to put pressure on each other without ascertaining the wrath of the two neutral parties.

  The Vigilant revere Kerberos giving it the name Fenris, and holding celebrations for the home it has bestowed upon them after its life, the land fertile from the blood coming from its veins. The citizens of Fenris follow the worship of a god not a kin to the recognized pantheon, although they recognize the normalized pantheon they still will pay homage to their witch-god.
