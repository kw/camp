name: Truthbound
award: 2
description: |
  For whatever reason, the character is bound to speak no lies. It may be a curse, or divine intervention, or a magical promise that has become binding. This means that the character is incapable of speaking a statement that they believe is false for the purposes of deceiving another. Written falsehoods are not covered by this Flaw, nor are spoken jokes and jests not meant to be taken seriously. If the player realizes that their character has lied, the character immediately takes Final damage equal to their Life Point total and they begin dying. Taking this Flaw reduces the Award for Fae Blood by 1.
