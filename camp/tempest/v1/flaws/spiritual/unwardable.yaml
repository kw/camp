description: |
  Whether it is due to a curse, a bloodline corrupted by dark powers, or some more mysterious magic, the character cannot be at ease inside a Ward spell or a Haven Ritual. While the character is inside an area protected by a Ward spell or Haven Ritual, they are inherently _Drained_ and cannot benefit from Hearth-granted benefits, Long or Short Rests. In fact, if the character spends more than two contiguous hours inside a Haven-protected building, they will lose their ability to recharge spell-slots, Powers, etc. at the next Long Rest. The character cannot take Othersleep Perk.
