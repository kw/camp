  The character can perform an easy rite, taking only a few seconds, which will sanctify a particular room. The character should pick a special item like a horseshoe, banner, or other significant, meaningful item, and place it inside the room to designate it as a Hearth. If the item is removed from the room for any reason, the Hearth Perks are lost until it is returned. If needed, once per Event, a new rite can be performed after the next Long Rest, using a new special item.

  The room becomes the characterâ€™s Hearth and they can develop certain powers that are only effective when in their Hearth by taking additional Hearth Perks. In order for a room to become a Hearth, it must be the room where the character intends to sleep next. In addition, the room cannot be a public or multi-use room such as a Tavern. If the room is normally public but is closed off for sleeping, that is acceptable (such as a small shop that is closed and used as living quarters). While performing the rite, the character can name five additional people who also intend to sleep in that room and the area will count as a Hearth for them as well. Those others count this as their Hearth and can purchase and use other Hearth Perks even if they have no ability to make the Hearth in the first place.
