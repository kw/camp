  Once, the character’s patron will save them from death. One time of the character’s choice, when the character would dissipate to Spirit form after dying, they may instead be the target of Grant Life by Agony. In addition, whenever the character is brought back to life from being dead, they come back with two Life Points instead of the normal one.
