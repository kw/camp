  Once, the character can call out a final prayer to their Patron to save those around them. They should call out “[Patron’s name], I give the Ultimate Gift!." They can now use three separate powers, at their discretion. They can call out “By My Voice Grant Life to [Names]” and give the names of any number of individuals, bringing them all back to life. They may call “By My Voice Heal 10 to [Names]” and heal all the named characters. They may also call out “By My Voice Short Grant Insubstantial to [Names]” When these things are complete, the character themself will die, immediately dissipate, taking Spirit form and heading for the Spirit Well. There they will burn one of their Keeper Cards permanently, then draw from one of their remaining Keepers if any remain. The character need not give a list of names and may just affect everyone within range.
