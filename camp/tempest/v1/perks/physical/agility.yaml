description: |
  The character is naturally agile and well-balanced. In any repped situation where the character might lose their balance or fall, or would generally be saved by agility, they should be given the widest possible interpretation. For example, if jumping from column to column, they only get the tips of their toes onto the column. This would normally cause a fall, but because the character is agile, they are judged to have managed the jump. This will not make impossible things possible, or outright break rules for physical obstacles.
