description: |
  The character has little desire to give up their body, and can remain dead for a Slow 300 before discorporating, rather than the normal 180. Any time after 180, they can let go and discorporate. This can be guided by player knowledge of what is occurring, as their Spirit gets some sort of sense of their surroundings after the initial Slow 180.
