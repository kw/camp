description: |
  Once per Long Rest, the character can focus for a Quick 100 to infuse themself with elemental energy. The element they can attune to is determined when the Perk is taken and must be chosen from Flame, Ice, Lightning, or Acid. The attunement only lasts until the end of the next Short Rest. While attuned, the character may resist a number of elemental effects of their chosen element equal to their Life Point Maximum per Event. In addition, they are able to alter the Accent of any elemental power they use to the chosen accent. However, they are unable to use powers with the opposition Accent.

  They also become Vulnerable to the opposite element, and take Effects from that element as Final. Flame and Ice are opposites, as are Lightning is the opposite of Acid. This Perk can be taken up to twice, and each time the character may choose any element they desire, although they may not to attune to more than one element at a time.
