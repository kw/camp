description: |
  The character has dragon ancestors. This manifests in a number of ways and the character’s draconic blood can express itself more as the character rises in level. The character should choose from Lightning, Flame, Ice, or Acid. In addition to the following benefits, dragons can sense the character’s blood as can, occasionally, dragon-related creatures such as kobolds.

  The character can counter one attack from their chosen draconic Accent by calling “Counter, Draconic Heritage." They can do this once per Short Rest. The character is affected by Powers that affect Dragons, ie: Calls that have the “to Dragon” Qualifier.
