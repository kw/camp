description: |
  The character does not sleep on the prime plane. When they slumber (true deep sleep, not normally napping) the character fades out of the world, disappearing from this plane. Their equipment and clothing all stays, but they are gone until the morning comes.

  OOG: the player should have a white halo with a start time and end time written on it and this should be posted in clear sight near their sleeping space; this time cannot be longer than 10 hours, nor less than 2 and is meant to protect sleep; if it appears it is being used defensively, or to protect from normal attacks, Staff may remove the Perk.

  During the time on the sheet, the character is not present and cannot be affected, harmed, killed, etc., although their equipment is not protected. NPCs will not bother the PC, and although combat may occur around them, effort will be taken not to specifically disturb the protected character and player. When the time written on the sheet arrives, the character will reappear in the same location. There is no way for them to come out early, even if others need help. They should remain out-of-game and non-interactive while they are in Othersleep. This will recharge each sunrise. Cannot take Unwardable Flaw.
