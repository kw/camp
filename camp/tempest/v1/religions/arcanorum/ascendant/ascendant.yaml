  _Accents: Time_

  _Primary Eye: Arcanorum_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of The Ascendant”_

  Linred, The Ascendant, is unique among the deities of the Tempest, in that they hail not from divine blood, but from beyond the horizon of time, reaching back through our future, their history, to elevate the past into divinity. Offering immortality to the truly faithful, “They That Free The Soul” asks that the faithful abhor violence and death, seeking to prolong the lives of all creation.

  Where possible, devotees to the Ascendant are pacifistic, opting to avoid violent confrontation, however, this is not an absolute, and devotees will act as necessity dictates in the defense of many lives. Similarly, the devotees of the Ascendant are notably generous with wealth and resources, opting to improve the lives of those around them, rather than hoarding wealth. Ascendants can often be found leading efforts to improve community resources, and taking on leadership roles to organize the populace against violent incursions.

  ## Tents of The Devoted

  * **Death is Abomination** - While there are many foes both physical and existential in our world, they all serve the Final Foe: Death. Oppose Death whenever possible.
  * **Violence as a Tool, Not as a Solution** - Our world is a violent one, and our devotees need to defend themselves and others. Seek out other options, but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.
  * **Seek Health over Wealth** - Generosity to the poor, the sick, and the dying is rewarded with eternal life. Give freely.
  * **Beware the Keepers** - The Keepers of Fate are the minions of Death, do not allow yourself to fall prey to their schemes.
  * **False Immortality** - Undeath, construct forms, and other forms of false immortality are prizes to lead one astray. Do not allow yourself to fall prey to these tricks.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Ascendant. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Ascendant is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Ascendant by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Ascendant By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
