    This spell can only be cast out of combat and the caster and target(s) can only have one **Connection** active at a time, and thus cannot cast nor be the target of this spell while they have a **Connection**.

    The target(s) that the caster connects to should sit down with the caster and meditate together for a few moments. The caster should explain that the two are now linked, a unity, a chorus of two, and that they can help each other. Both the caster and the target(s) have the following three Powers until they complete a Long Rest, or use a number of charges equal to double their Maximum Life Points. These Powers may only be used on each other.

    **Transfer Health**: After incanting _“I call on our connection,”_ they may use one Charge and Sacrifice 1 Life Point to Touch a connected target and call “Heal 1 by Mind.” This cannot be used if the user is at 0 Life Points.

    **Transfer Steel**: After incanting _“I call on our connection,”_ they may use one Charge and Sacrifice 1 Armor Point to Touch a connected target and call “Mend 1 by Mind.” This cannot be used if the user is at 0 Armor Points.

    **Transfer Might**: After incanting _“I call on our connection,”_ they may use one Charge and Sacrifice 1 Spike to Touch a connected target and call “Grant 1 Spike.” This cannot be used if the user has 0 Spikes remaining.

    This spell, when cast with an Adept-tier spell-slot can include an additional target, making the connection with the caster and two others. A Greater-tier spell-slot allows up to three targets and the caster. A Master-tier spell-slot will join up to five targets and the caster.
