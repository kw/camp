  ## Description

  The Ember Light, one of the pre-eminent religions of the realm, counts innumerable adherents across both Summum and Solum; these faithful are commonly referred to as Embers. Their leadership, the priests, also known as Sparks, lead the three primary rituals across the seasons, tending a bonfire in each town that remains lit for the entirety of the year.

  Each of these festivals centers around the worship of the Triune Flame: One deity that has three aspects, represented by Hyrun, the Spark of Ambition; Phirio the Everburning Ember; and Yaziri, the Blazing Inferno.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Ember Light. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Ember Light, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Ember Light by Radiance”. Toric hears this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Ember Light By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
