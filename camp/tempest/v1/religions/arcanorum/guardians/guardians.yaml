name: The Guardians

  _Accent: Will_

  _Primary Eye: Arcanorum_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of The Guardians”_

  ## Description

  Built around the Highlord Aeterius, The Vigilant Kemis, and the Watcher Voxus - the faith of the Guardians regards these deific entities as heroes in the never ending battle against the Eclipsed Bonetaker. While widely believed to be an aspect of Sodron the Shrouded, faithful adherents never speak the Great Enemy’s name aloud, for fear of drawing that entity's gaze.

  Whatever the case, the more strident of the faith have poured into the continent, many bound and determined to reclaim the ancient places of worship, and re-consecrate them, hoping to create bulwarks against the endless tide of unholy abominations that stream outward from the east.

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * **Decisiveness**: Firmness of mind in taking a stand, reaching a conclusion, making a decision. It requires both courage and discernment.
  * **Forbearance**: Tolerating hardship with good grace. Not allowing the trials of life to steal our joy.
  * **Hope**: Looking to the future with trust and faith. Optimism in the face of adversity.
  * **Justice**: Being fair in all we do. Making amends when we have hurt or wronged others. Protecting everyone’s rights, including our own.
  * **Reliability**: Being dependable. Being a promise keeper. Taking responsibility with trustworthiness.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Guardians. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Guardians, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Guardians by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Guardians By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
