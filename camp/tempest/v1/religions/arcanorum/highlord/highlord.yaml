  _Accents: Radiance_

  _Primary Eye: Arcanorum_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of The Highlord”_

  ## Description

  Hailing from the heavens above, Highlord Aeterius the Sun-Crowned is a recent addition to the deities of Tempest, if one can speak of the several dozen lifetimes that have passed since their arrival as “recent”, however, being the progeny of one of the other deities, a certain allowance must be made.
  The center of worship for the Highlord, naturally, is  the Isle of Krell, where the theocratic government is centered upon their worship and service. However, adherents of the Highlord can be found far and wide, scattered across the known lands, as missionaries, clerics in service of expeditionary forces, and adventurers.

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * **Courtesy**: Treating others with kindness, tact and graciousness.
  * **Integrity**: Standing on moral high ground. Keeping faith with our ideals and our agreements.
  * **Perseverance**: Staying the course for however long it takes. Steadfastness and persistence in pursuing our goals.
  * **Self-Control**: Experiencing our feelings without allowing them to control us. Stepping back and thoughtfully choosing how we will act rather than just reacting.
  * **Indomitable Spirit**: The strength of spirit to recover from adversity. Overcoming obstacles by tapping into a deep well of faith and endurance.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier “Follower of The Highlord”. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to the Highlord, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Highlord by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Highlord By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend, Killian) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
