  _Qualifier: “Follower of The Manifold Path”_

  > "And thus were the Nine Divines heralded, each with their place in the heavens, ruling over the disparate domains of Arcanorum. Then from horizons beyond the Ascendant, Linred, arrived: a Divine not yet born, yet eternal.
  >
  > Thus it was shown that supplication to the Divine was possible without singling out a Deity: even the Deities, once thought ever-present, might come and go, and the heavens might shift and churn, but the order of the universe was eternal: Divine above, mortal below, each serving their own place in the cosmos.
  >
  > And so we worship the Divine as a whole, rather than a single figurehead. The Aspects of Divinity serve mortals as we serve the Divine, in a great Circle…

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * The Level Field - No God shall be raised up above all others, each shall be given their due, and respect for their domain acknowledged.
  * The Divine Chorus - No God’s reverence shall be left fallow. Each Deity is worthy of prayer and supplication in the face of mortal need.
  * The Shrine of the Manifold Path - A Shrine shall be constructed, tended, and given prayer to, such that those that might aid us may hear us.
  * The Divine Order - While no God may rise above the rest, they are ascendant above mortals, and attempts to bring the Gods low, or elevate mortals to the Divine are heresy.
  * A Token of Faith - The Manifold Path requires the careful balance of many conflicting ideologies, but none may rise above the Path itself. Carry with you a token of our faith, both symbolic and conduit for divine power.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  The Worshippers of the Manifold Path believe that no single Deity can claim to be perfection in all things. While they have a domain with appropriate strengths to maintain dominance within it, a mortal’s life is mercurial: within a day’s time a mortal's needs may shift from being hungry, needing strength, requiring shelter, or craving peace. There is no God with a domain so broad as to capture and quell all those needs.

  Thus, the leadership of the Manifold Path chose to beseech the Gods for their aid in a way that had not been done before: instead of adhering to a single God’s preferences and following the tenets of one devotion, offerings would be made to the entire pantheon of Gods in the hope of currying all of their favor.

  As one might expect, it would be impossible to secure the blessings of all Gods at once, however, consistent devotion shown to all would at least maintain their favor, with focus applied with elaborate rituals when a stronger blessing was needed.

  Followers of The Manifold Path understand they will never carry blessings as strong as the faithful with a singular focus to their God, but they will be able to curry favor for a particular Deity whose strengths align with their current cause.

  Conflicts naturally arise with these practices. Not all Gods get along, causing strife and backlash from time to time. However, the followers of this Religion attempt to pay homage in their own ways, placating the greater beings until true favors must be asked of them.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Manifold Path. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Manifold Path is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Manifold Path by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Manifold Path By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
