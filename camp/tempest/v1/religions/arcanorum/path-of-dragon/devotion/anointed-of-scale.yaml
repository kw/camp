  _The acolyte of dragon must take the Steps of the Scale, the first of which is to join the Sire in blood. To become one with the Path, one must become one with the Sire - only then may the clarity of mind and guidance of spirit take hold._

  The character gains the first level of the Draconic Heritage Perk, ignoring the restriction disallowing it after character creation. This CP cost is refunded if they already have the Perk.
