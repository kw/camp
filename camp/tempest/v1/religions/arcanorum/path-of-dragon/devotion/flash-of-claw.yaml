  _“The Theurge spun with grace and ease deftly dodging the blows of their students: no less than four Acolytes, all well trained and skilled with the blade, allowing not a single blow to land. And yet, when the battle was over, the chagrined students protested that while they had not landed a blow upon the master, that he too had failed to land on of his own. Only then did the master smile and ask: ‘Are you so sure?’”_

    Once this spell is cast, the caster gains a number of charges of “Double 1” equal to the amount of CP spent in this religion. These charges are lost if the caster becomes Helpless or completes a Short Rest.

    If the caster expends a Spike, they may add two to the call and add the Lightning Accent, making the call “Double 3 by Lightning.”

    The first time this spell is cast each long rest it will not consume a spell slot.
