  ## Description

  Known far and wide as the “First of the First,” Dragon was the very first of the First Children created by the Divines of Arcanorum. While his name is now synonymous with magical scaled lizards of varying shapes, colors, and myths, this creature was the first to bear the name “Dragon.” Many of their descendants spun off into various shapes and forms as the world was populated, but more than most, the serpentine First Children can claim to have descended directly from Dragon, a point often intoned with pride.

  The Path of the Dragon seeks to enrich and reinforce this connection with the First of the First, drawing from the bloodlines of the First and seeking out the connection with the divine aspects of their creation. Through this reverence and inward contemplation, the Acolytes of the Dragon seek to purify and express the power inborn into each of them by their divine heritage.

  Those unfortunate enough to not bear this lineage are not without hope, however, as all are of divine creation of one sort or another, and adherence to the Path can infuse the Acolyte with the bloodline lineage they seek through trial and ritual.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Dragon. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to Dragon, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of Dragon by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of Dragon By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
