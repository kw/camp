    A powerful pulse of energy comes from the Cleric, washing over all nearby adherents granting each target two points of Barrier. If a Greater spell-slot is used to cast this spell, it will Grant Barrier 4 to Followers of the Sentinel. A Master spell-slot will Grant Barrier 5 (with no qualifier), and the caster gains Short Resistance to Fear.

    The first time this spell is cast each long rest it will not consume a spell slot.
