  ## Description

  Kemis, The Sentinel, is the traditional deity of the northern lands of Solum, common throughout Hjalmor, The Brassics, the Tarandri Steppes, Thetlin, and some northern provinces of Edos. A “deity of the people,” Kemis is highly regarded in more rural lands, as the core facets of protection, community, and defense against the darkness are more central, practical matters on the minds of the people there.

  However, that is not to say there aren’t more urbane adherents: transplants from the outskirts, houses on the political rise from serfdom, and soldiers returning home from distant lands ensure that every major city has at least one center of worship for the Vigilant.

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * **Equality**: Treat all with respect and dignity, without regard for gender, breed, disability, class, or wealth.
  * **Honor**: Strive for justice, grace, and integrity in all things.
  * **Self-Respect**:  Accepting praise with humility and gratitude. Sacrifice not the body, mind, or will for power.
  * **Courage**: Transform fear into determination. Embrace life fully, without holding back, doing what must be done even when it is difficult or risky.
  * **Compassion**: Deep empathy for the suffering of others. Compassion flows freely from the heart when we let go of judgments and seek to understand.

  _**Note**_: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team.
  Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Sentinel. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to the Sentinel, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of the Sentinel by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Sentinel By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
