    While out of combat, the caster may lay their hands upon an ally, inscribe a prayer (apply a sigil) to the Ever Watchful upon a shield and make that shield nigh invulnerable to damage. This spell lasts until the target has 0 Life Points, is Dead or takes a Short Rest.

    The first time this spell is cast each long rest it will not consume a spell slot.
