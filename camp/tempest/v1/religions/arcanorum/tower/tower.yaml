name: The Tower

  _Accents: Force_

  _Primary Eye: Arcanorum_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of The Tower”_

  ## Description

  The primary deity of The Tower is known as Voxus Thousand-Eye, and this enigmatic deity is difficult to pin down, as they tend not to express their will directly, nor do so often. Many an adherent goes years if not decades with nary a direct contact from the deity or its messengers, only one day to receive a letter or visit from a simulacrum requiring some task, and, upon its completion to be left in the dark once again.

  However, the collective action exerted by the deity, through its followers, is undeniable: reports from distant lands return news that a crucial turn of events ended favorably, if but for a sudden shift in circumstances. When these fortuitous events transpire, look closely, and you will find a quiet adherent of The Tower doing their deity's will.
  Aligned as often with the arcane magics as the divine, Voxus’ adherents tend to be from the southern ends of Solum: Elyra, Vedea, southern Edos, and Copoa. Recently, Voxus’ worship has extended to Qairus, presumably due to the influx of Elyrans and Vedeans there.

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * **Commitment**: Caring deeply about a person, a goal or a belief. Willingness to give our all and keep our promises.
  * **Cooperation**: Working together for a common goal, calling on the different gifts each of us has to offer.
  * **Resilience**: The strength of spirit to recover from adversity. Overcoming obstacles by tapping into a deep well of faith and endurance.
  * **Moderation**: Engage fully with life, but avoid temptations of the body, mind, and spirit that would undermine your works and virtues.
  * **Tact**: Telling the truth kindly. Thinking before we speak, aware of how deeply our words affect others. Discerning what to say, when it is timely to say it, and what is better left unsaid.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Tower. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Tower is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Tower by Radiance.” Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Tower By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
