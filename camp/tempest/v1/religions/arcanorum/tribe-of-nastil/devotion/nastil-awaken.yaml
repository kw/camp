  _“The Body may be bound in ropes and chains, easily freed, but the Mind is not so easily released: the thoughts of the oppressed circle like a whirlpool, reinforcing their own imprisonment. Only through forceful action, through pain, can they be freed. Many will recoil from change and uncertainty, but you must be the herald of what’s to come: unfettered sight into the world as it is, and not the illusion that governs most.”_
