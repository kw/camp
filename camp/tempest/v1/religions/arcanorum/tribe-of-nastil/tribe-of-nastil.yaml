  _Accent: Agony_

  _Primary Eye: Arcanorum_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of Nastil”_

  > _"The Riotous One calls us to cast down the chains of our supposed saviors: where we were once bound in chains of iron, now we succumb to the chains of the mind._
  > _No more: we rebuke those who would subvert our free will, our minds, and our spirits. Let none tread upon the Tribe, and those that would dare shall taste the blood of their severed tongues that they might lie no more._
  > _The sun claims providence over all the sky, but the night always falls, erasing sight, leaving the huddled to fend for themselves… and where there is no light, there is always the night, the freedom to do as we will, and so we shall take it."_
  > _~ Bhola, Nastil Priest_

  Tenets of The Devoted

  * **The Riotous**: Challenge authority; if it cannot stand up to being tested it should fall.
  * **Scythe Heart**: Cut away that which serves no purpose, doubly so that which restricts and restrains.
  * **The Ungilted**: Wealth is its own trap of the mind: reject the material that serves only itself.
  * **Blood Unto Me**: Battle, war, combat and death draw blood, call unto me alone with its gifts.
  * **The Final Path**: Seek not the comforts of eternal life, pacts with the otherworldly, nor the Dark.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  Nastil is not spoken of well in polite society. The Riotous One is anathema to kingdoms, cities, and even palatial estates. Scythe-Heart reaches out and empowers those who are disenfranchised, marginalized, and oppressed. Power flows to those looking to tear down established orders, and topple reigning monarchs, which is of little use to those enjoying their seats of power and influence.

  Offerings to Nastil are appropriate when your progress is being opposed, change is required, and the peace of Olfrin and Voxus will not sway your opponent’s hearts.

  It is believed that Nastil favors survivors. Small communities and tribes who collectively add to the whole are blessed by “They That Usher The Final Path”, as each one contributes to the progress of themselves and those around them. When one attempts to rise above, lifted on the shoulders of others who touch the earth and mold iron, Nastil’s vengeance stokes hotter than molten erupting from the earth.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Nastil. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  For Example: Toric, devoted to the Nastil, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of Nastil by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call.

  Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of Nastil By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not.
