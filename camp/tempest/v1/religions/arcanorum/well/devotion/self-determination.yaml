    While Berserked, Charmed, and/or Slept, the adherent may expend a single Spike to Cure one of those Conditions on themselves. This power refreshes immediately to be used again against each of these Conditions; but may only be Cured of each Condition in this way once per Short Rest. This power may be used while Berserked, Charmed, and Slept, even though normally you would otherwise not be able to.
