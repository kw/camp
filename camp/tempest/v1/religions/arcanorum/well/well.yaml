  _Qualifier: “Follower of The Well”_

  ## Description

  Of the “_well_ known” religions, The Well boasts the least number of adherents, as the structures of the faith's doctrines are often difficult to reconcile with the world at large. What is easy, convenient, and practical can often come at odds with the faith’s tenets, causing friction with the general populace.

  However, internally, the faith itself is ever generous with its adherents, recognizing the difficulties of life are omni-present. A culture of acceptance of mistakes with appropriate recompense winds its way through the faith, leading to a quiet serenity and compassion from the adherents of the faith, and a wide forbearance towards non-adherents.
  Truly, The Well ascribes to “leading by example” in its doctrines, rather than punishing failures. Many of its most revered heroes are those who came from a background rife with failure, greed, and dishonesty yet rose above their former lives.

  ## Tenets of the Devoted

  * **Truthfulness**: Truth is the bedrock of integrity on which we build all our other virtues. An ongoing commitment to live by what is most real and authentic in our own nature. Honesty in all our dealings.
  * **Detachment**: Experiencing our feelings without allowing them to control us. Stepping back and thoughtfully choosing how we will act rather than just reacting.
  * **Dignity**: Honoring the worth of all people, including ourselves and treating everyone with respect.
  * **Diligence**: Doing what needs to be done with care, concentration and single-pointed attention, giving our absolute best.
  * **Wisdom**: Having a discerning mind, based on experience and mindfulness. Making wise decisions based on our deepest understandings.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Well. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Well, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower ofThe Well by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Well By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
