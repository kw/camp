  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * Never take an innocent life, nor aid in the harming of those undeserving.
  * Always strive to have the slightest impact on the natural world, as every living thing is sacred and deserving of respect.
  * Defend yourself if you must, but do not actively seek to harm others.
  * Practice understanding and compassion, and actively offer to shepherd others away from violence when you can. Seek amicable ends to your dealings.

  ## Description

  Followers of the Worldsoul in general venerate these three following concepts:

  * **The Worldsoul**: A powerful, connective lifeforce that links all living things. The Worldsoul is able to nourish this connection. General practice identifies the Worldsoul as a singular entity, like a god, but it is unclear if the Worldsoul has any physical embodiment or avatar. The Worldsoul is believed to be rooted somewhere in the First Ever-Autumn Forest, or is, perhaps, the First Forest itself. It is widely believed by practitioners of the Worldsoul faith that the First Ever-Autumn Forest is the physical manifestation of the Worldsoul.
  * **The Ever-Autumn Forest**: A demi-plane that has spread to this world by the Worldsoul’s Divine Magic. It is the birthplace of the Thrylossi, and they were the first practitioners of the Worldsoul faith. It earns its name from the divine sphere of influence the forest has: keeping the winds brisk and the leaves golden, orange, and red. Deep within the Ever-Autumn forest is a Stormbridge to the First Ever-Autumn Forest.
  * **The Lifestream**: From the First Ever-Autumn Forest, a tributary of water expands across all worlds that the Ever-Autumn is found. These are known as The Lifestreams, and they serve as guides for lost spirits to return to their final resting place in the heart of the First Ever-Autumn Forest.

  Many communities welcome practitioners of the Worldsoul faith, however, it is not recognized as a deity in the same way as the Arcanorum Pantheon or the Witch-Gods. Scholars have often debated its classification, but its practice is still widespread nonetheless.

  During the autumnal solstice, many Children of the Worldsoul gather in song and merriment. Each festival is wildly different, as they are a loosely organized group, but they tend to be uplifting and accessible to all who would wish to participate.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Worldsoul. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Worldsoul, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of the Worldsoul by Radiance.” Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of the Worldsoul By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
