  _“To speak of the Lifestream in good faith and earnest, is to invite it within yourself. It is to offer your heart to your friends, your family, and those who simply walk beside you at each gathering. While you may be the shepherd of their flock, it is for their flock that you find purpose, and the purpose that is found is guided by the Lifestream.”_
