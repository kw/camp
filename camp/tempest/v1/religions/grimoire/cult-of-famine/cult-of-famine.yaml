  _Accent: Ice_

  _Primary Eye: Grimoire_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of Famine”_

  > _“Know the name Erasmus, the God-Sufferer. In his sacrifice, we, the Gheist, were born. His desire to defy the tyranny and destruction of the world compelled him to steal away the Grimoire of Famine, and it is for that, we are each indebted. This we know, for the Sufferer Wyndle Pendleton brought with him from the Grimwalds of Nocturnen this: the Litany of Erasmus's last moments. The words of the Red Mother guiding him to Ascension, and now, his seat as the Witch-God Famine. The powers of the Dark still yet rise and we are uniquely tasked with the capacity to resist them._
  >
  > _Erasmus asked a Diavallan for Her forgiveness before his ascension- and through our actions, together, his forgiveness shall be earned. Erasmus may be gone, but Famine lives on, in each of us. And our Witch-God shall endure eternal. His is the path of the Ascetic. His, the oath of Temperance._
  >
  > _“I will do what I must, become what I must, or others shall pay direly the price for my inaction.”_
  >
  > _These were the pillars upon which Erasmus ascended. These simple words are what drive a grieving man to defy king and country for the Greater Good._
  >
  > _We will endure all that this gift brings to us, not only because we must, but because we are among the few who can._
  >
  > _Our Starving God lives on, eternal, through the hunger within each of us, gathering strength from our feeding, for Him. For all that he has sacrificed for us, we shall sacrifice in return for him."_
  >
  > _- Fell Erasmi, author of the Liber Fames._

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  - Embrace The Erasmian Gift. Those Hollow and wasting by the passing of the Witch-God Famine are blessed, and every attempt should be made to support their new existence, rather than restore their old life.
  - The Erasmian Gift gives life energy directly to the natal Witch-God by consuming the bodies and energy of those who have defiled the world. Consume those sinful and deserving, but never unjustly kill.
  - Beware the Third Circle. Shepherd those who do not control their hunger ardently. Each Ghoul was once Gheist, and each Ghoul is a fragment of the Starving God’s power forever lost to madness.

  ## Description

  The Cult of Famine is the name of a small cult that formed, primarily of former Diavallan clergy folk afflicted with the Curse of Erasmus after his death. Following the emancipation of Valgast from Leonholdt occupation, these Gheist sought answers to the events that transpired in Nocturnen from the only known survivor of it: The Sufferer Wyndle Pendleton. He gave those individuals two journals; One, written in The Sufferer Erasmus of Valgast’s own hand, and the second, written by an Exemplar by the name of Fell Erasmi, who firsthand witnessed the creation of the gheist following Erasmus’s reading of his Grimoire.

  The writings of the journal inspired Fell Erasmi to write the Liber Fames, a tome containing ways that Fell directly felt empowered Famine, and Erasmus. In the tome, Fell describes both first hand experiences with the primordial Gheist. Fell described something known as a “Valgheist,” a folk spirit of Valgast that wanders the Forest of Mourning, hunting and eating evil-doers. This sets the stage for Fell’s work, and he uses Valgheist as the inspiration to name the newly resurgent breed “Gheist.” He also describes a ritual to transmit the Curse of Erasmus from an individual with it and another who wishes to become an Erasmian; a word he often used to describe somebody afflicted with the Curse of Erasmus.

  He states that an Erasmian bears their curse in three distinct Circles of Famine. The circles can sometimes overlap, but, usually, an Erasmian belongs to one primary circle.

  Erasmians under the First Circle of Famine have the Curse and are therefore Hollow, but otherwise are not Gheist and do not have any other traits associated with Gheistdom.

  The Second Circle of Famine includes all Gheist, and those who have obvious alterations to their corporeal and incorporeal forms. Fell described three unique types of Gheist- “Gheist”, being the largest of those within the Second Circle, and two smaller groups, “Revenant” and “Poltergheist”, both also named after Valgaesti folklore. Gheist belonging to the Second often make a conscious effort in blending in with society and otherwise attempting to live their lives in a civilized manner. Uniquely, not all Gheist within the Second Circle of Famine gain the Gift of Erasmus, but they still draw their power from Famine and have been transformed by it. Researchers following the Cult of Erasmus have identified that The Second Circle of Famine somehow was able to affect various individuals on Ephemera completely unrelated to the events transpiring on Nocturnen, including a few select individuals on Arcanorum as well. These people transformed to Gheist at the same moment of Erasmus’s ascension, though, no evidence has ever been provided as to why.

  The Third Circle describes those who have the Curse of Erasmus, but do not practice Erasmian temperance. They are looked at with pity, as those within the Third Circle are believed to eventually fall away from Erasmus’s favor, becoming mindless ghouls consumed by the appetite for their own kin. Most Erasmians believe these individuals cannot be “cured”, but those belonging to the Cult of Famine believe that it is the Cult’s duty to shephard those within the Third Circle in asceticism and temperance, to prevent them from becoming Ghoul.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Famine. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Cult of Famine, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of Famine by Darkness”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of Famine By Malice.” As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
