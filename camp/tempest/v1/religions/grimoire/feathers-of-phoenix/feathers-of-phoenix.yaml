  > “It was terrifying. We were getting slaughtered, the beasts were running rampant and our city’s defenders were scattered. There was so much death, so many tears and pain.
  >
  > And then… there was the Phoenix. Just standing there. Stepping forward from a burning building, tears in her eyes and smoke billowing around her. She started crying, and with this howl of anguish, the beasts just went up in flames! I can’t even begin to describe what it felt like to see that. After she’d reduced the monsters to ash, she took the wounded, and wept over their broken bodies. You wouldn’t believe it, but those tears, they brought back the dead. I know it sounds insane, but Phoenix walks amongst us, and I wouldn’t be here without her.”

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * Do no harm to the innocent.
  * Follow your heart and emotions, do not let others quell that flame.
  * Practice mercy and compassion, but understand when both must end.
  * Actively seek evil and snuff it from the land where you can.
  * Do not allow others to suffer tyranny or oppression.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  * Faith leadership within her clergy refer to themselves as Feathers.
  * In the Summer, Cults and Churches of Phoenix gather in a large festival dedicated to those lost before Phoenix’s awakening. The Feathers construct large bonfires, and after a sermon, it is lit with a parchment bearing the names of the friends and family that have been lost over the past year.  The celebration lasts from dusk till dawn.
  * Phoenix is an Ascendant deity, having previously lived a humble life as Ariadne Brighthearth, a mortal Human.
  * The holy text of Phoenix is known as The Singed Scripture, and is storied to have been written by her own hand and later transcribed by her disciples.
  * **First Aspect**: Phoenix is an entity rooted in base emotion, and that aspect is transferred to her Feathers.
  * **Second Aspect**: The Singed Scripture demands Feathers to practice mercy and compassion. Feathers are to heal the sick and dying without question or pause, though are permitted to revoke their practice should they feel that they are being taken advantage of.
  * **Third Aspect**: Feathers preach of Retribution to the wicked. It is for Retribution’s sake that Ariadne ascended with the use of Phoenix’s grimoire, and they honor this moment by continuing her crusade against evil.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Phoenix. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Linvalla, devoted to Phoenix is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of her order, Ashatari. Ashatari prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of Phoenix by Radiance.” Linvalla heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Linvalla’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of Phoenix By Malice.” As before, Linvala, (and her cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
