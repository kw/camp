  _Accent: Radiance_

  _Primary Eye: Grimoire_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of Leovitrius”_

  _“Brothers and sisters, Children of Leovitrius all… I bid you to hear my words and mark them well! While it is true that the Great Lion was a victim of Neveshkan treachery and was grievously wounded, our lord still lives! Fear not the fate of our God for once such as he shall never be laid low by the schemes of the unworthy. Indeed the nobility of our cause and strength of our faith will return him to providence and resplendence in due course._

  _Let it be known that neither the Great Leovitrius nor his Resplendent children shall rest until those who would defile our way of life are held to account for their crimes. Heretics within our own order aided the foul Neveshkan Praetor in his assault on the Great Lion and they shall be the first to face our righteous retribution! The glorious duty to strike back against the filth that lurks within the hearts of lesser men falls then to us brothers and sisters!_

  _In the glorious name of Leovitrius, rise up Resplendent! I bid thee hear my words as you would the Lion’s Roar and raise your blades high! The time has come to usher in a brighter future for all! Let this day mark the dawn of a bright new era, one where our light sears the darkness from our world. We children of the Great Lion shall no longer suffer evil to fester amongst us. By blade and fire we shall see to it that never again shall the honorable be made to suffer the yoke of ignoble cowards. By shield and faith shall we ensure that the innocent need not fear the evil of corrupt fools._

  _I bid thee rise once more and claim your place as Glorybound and join me in marching upon the Resplendent Cathedral so that we may mete out the Lion’s justice AND enact his vengeance. In the name of the Glorious Lion, may your righteous blades carve a swathe through the heretics and find a fitting resting place within the heart of the wicked!"_

  _- Grand Arbiter Alexi Sicai_

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * Strive for glory in all that you do. It is for Glory’s sake that you are made worthy in the eyes of the Resplendent Lion.
  * The Lion fears not the Plagued, insignificant things, nor does he listen to their law. The Tenets of Levotitrius is the Law of Glory, and always you shall follow it over the Unclean Laws.
  * Glory holds no place to liars, cheaters, or thieves. Glorybound are never permitted to lower themselves to the Filth by doing either three.
  * Evil takes many forms, and wears the face of normalcy. Be wary of others that do not follow the Lion’s Law, for there, Fetid Things fester under an unwashed spirit.
  Die with Glory, if you must- but never retreat.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  * Leovitrus is widely worshiped: nearly every culture with a strong warrior tradition worships the God of Glory in some form or another. It is fair to say however, that the Great Lion facet worshiped so fervently by the Resplendent of Leonholdt is by far the most well known.
  * While Leovitrus is revered as the God of Glory and is most often thought of as a warrior’s god, his Glorybound followers are keen to apply the ideals of the faith in other aspects of their lives for the betterment of themselves and those around them.
  * In recent years the Leovitrain faith has experienced a great upheaval and restructuring. Under the guidance of the Grand Arbiter, the Leovitrains have become a more militarized and battle ready organization that have reaffirmed their dedication to bringing glory to Leovitrus’s name.
  * While the term “Leovitrian” in reference to a follower of Leovitrius is still commonplace, the members of the reformed faith are referred to as “Glorybound”.
  * During the spring, The Glorybound observes a yearly holy day known as the Festival of the Exalted. It is tradition to gather, feast and most importantly reenact tales of the heroics of fallen heroes so that their memories may live on and that the stories of glory and courage might inspire the next generation.
  * Leovitrus was near mortality wounded by the Neveshkan Praetor and his heretical allies. It is believed by many that the Grand Arbiter’s crusade is an effort to restore the wounded deities' strength by bringing glory to places of the world that know only wickedness.
  * **First Aspect**: Leovitrus takes the form of the mighty lion because like the lion he is a being of majesty, courage, strength and protection. Thus are the aspects the Glorybound strive to embody.
  * **Second Aspect**: The Lion’s Law requires not that one be pure of heart, but to seek their hearts purification through their deeds. While mortals are inherently flawed creatures, it is the struggle in the face of that fact and the desire to create a better world that Glory may be found.
  * **Third Aspect**: As the Resplendent Lion stands as the pinnacle of glory and honor. The Glorybound are to embody all that mortalkind should strive to become. Thus the Glorybound must hold themselves to a higher standard so that one's deeds may serve to inspire further glory.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Leovitrius. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to Leovitrius is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of Leovitrius by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of Leovitrius By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
