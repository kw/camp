  _Accent: Ice_

  _Primary Eye: Grimoire_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of Kerberos”_

  > _“Long has the Great Houses of Fenris honored Noble Kerberos, who’s body protected this land from evils uncountable and ancient. As he slumbered, he anointed our lands with his blood and his breath, bearing with him a warning: The Dark will come, and to be ready. Find Order in chaos. Ephemera divided may yet fall, but united, we stand a much greater chance against the howling horrors that unfold endlessly between the worlds.  It is through unity that we may find our salvation: Not alone, as the lone Sentinels against the dark, but united, as the Cause of One: The Mortal Breeds, against the Inevitable Dark that will come.”_
  > _- Vexillis Canis of House Strongarm, High Exemplar of Kerberos_

  ## Tenets of the Devoted

  * Protect the Lifestream, harshly and condemn those who would see it harmed. Cold is Kereberos’s claws against the throats of those who would exploit the Worldsoul’s blessings.
  * Stand as a bulwark against the tide of the Dark.  Raise your silver shield and let the fangs of the monstrous break upon it.
  * Foster unity and community.  Where others may see suspicions, find the silver of their spirit and glorify it. Do not suffer otherization: All mortals exist within the same circle, and that circle must be united. Seek to understand, rather than rectify.
  * Defend ardently those who stand behind you, and be their bastion in their final hours. Do not leave behind any person who depended on your strength.
  * Improve yourself and shepherd those who rely on you. Support those who rally to your cause. Seek to lift those up around you, and never shrug responsibilities placed upon your shoulders.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  Kerberos, The Nine Eyed Sentinel is a witch-god whose teachings place importance on many aspects of unity and community. It is through his faith that the three houses of Fenris came together and united as Fenris against an ancient enemy: The Void Wyrm. As the Void Wyrm made his way towards Fenris, Kerberos saw the Darkness that came with him, and with three mouths barked a warning, demanding that The Wyrm stand down and flee Fenris. The Void Wyrm did so, though he did not flee, he chose to turn his attention to the Wolf’s neighbor: a Great Lion resting in the resplendent fields to the west. Leovitrius.

  Kerberos came to Leovitrius’s aid, and together, they banished the Void Wyrm, but not without sustaining injuries. Kerberos was mortally wounded, and his body was brought back to Fenris by Leovitrius to rest.  His resting place is within Mount Fenris, a guarded, sacred place where the Lifestream of the Ever-Autumn flows. There, his waning body was placed within the waters, that he may eternally guard the spirits of those he stalwartly protected.

  Sentinel faith puts great merit behind unity. Leovitrius did not ask for aid, but Kerberos answered. There are those who would speak of this as martyrdom: but the Sentinels see it more akin to duty. It was Kerberos’s purpose to guard against the Dark, and when that Dark turned away from He to his neighbor, he continued to identify it as a threat.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of Kerberos. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to Kerberos is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of Kerberos by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of Kerberos By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
