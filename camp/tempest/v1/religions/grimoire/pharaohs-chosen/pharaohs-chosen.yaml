name: Pharaoh's Chosen
description: |
  _Accent: Darkness_

  _Primary Eye: Grimoire_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of the Pharaoh”_

  > _"To the Pauper we bring our tithe, a copper piece for each of us. Into his hands we ask that he shepherd our humble offering to the Ferrier, for he alone shall shepherd us beyond the Dark River._
  >
  > _When the Dark river comes in the cloak of night, listen to the whispered words. It shall guide you, and shield you from those that might lead you astray._
  >
  > _Remember always that we are but sojourners, ever waiting for the blessed day that we may meet our Pharaoh: He, that shall guide us to our final home.”_

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * Give copper Tithe to the Paupers, for Copper is the coin of the Pharaoh.
  * Do not make bargain nor gambit on your own life, for you are a subject of the Pharaoh, and your life is his to take.
  * As the Chosen of the Tithe, you must act as his scythe to cull those who elude Death. Necromancers and those who extend their life beyond the thread that has been spun for them are all enemies of the Pharaoh.
  * Do not offer the gifts of the Pharaoh for free. As you pay Tithe for your divine boons, so too must you demand tithe of those who you aid.
  * Shepherd the doomed and dying with a gentle, yet firm hand. Give the Ferrier’s tithe to those deserving peace, and omit it from those who do not.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  * The Pharaoh is a Witch-God who has shrines scattered across the world in the form of Paupers. * These Paupers are found within every land, and are often journeyed to by the Chosen.
  * Those who pay tithes to the Pharaoh are often rewarded, should he take notice of their offering.
  * There is no clergy of the Pharaoh, but individuals claim to spread his guidance through dreams and ancient texts.
  * _Nothing can escape death._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of the Pharaoh. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to the Pharoah’s Chosen, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of the Pharaohs’ Chosen by Radiance.” Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of  the Pharoah’s Chosen By Malice.” As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
