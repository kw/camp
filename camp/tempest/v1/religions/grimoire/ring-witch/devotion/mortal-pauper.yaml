    To give this one a sweet good night, a copper guarantees.
    I know, until the Keepers’ chime, thy time has come too soon.“

    The Ring Witch may Sacrifice a piece of worked copper or a copper  trinket, such a coin or ring, to call one of two effects:

    * Death to Helpless by Darkness Final. The Ring Witch may Heal 1 by Radiance.
    * Stabilize by Radiance. The Ring Witch takes a Quick Drain by Darkness.  

    **Note**: The copper trinket must be placed into the Ash Bin and becomes property of the game. Simple copper wire is not a suitable sacrifice, but crafts made of it can be.
