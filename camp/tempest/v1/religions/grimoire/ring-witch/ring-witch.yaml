  > _Accent: Darkness/Radiance_

  > _Qualifier: “Follower of the Pharaoh” and “Follower of The Worldsoul”_

  > "Life and death are but one unbroken ring: a symbol of eternity. Now and evermore, over and again, forever. That which lives, dies. That which dies feeds new life into the soil, and renews the world around it.
  >
  > This world is not the first that The Death God has visited. It may not be the last. With it, the Worldsoul blooms in his wake. He brings new life to the worlds in which he takes life from, feeding it as it feeds him. In this way, The Death God is, and will always be, the punctuation of life's trials.
  >
  > But it is not the Death God who breathes life into that which he takes. Instead, it is the Worldsoul that brings the new life forward. From the lifestream that flows through all lands blessed by golden leaves and eternal life, to the darkened boughs of the Grimm, all that the Worldsoul is enables the cycle to continue, not only in this eye, but many others. To deny the Worldsoul its grace is to deny life its due diligence.
  >
  > To respect the life the Worldsoul gives is utmost to the Ring Witch: The gifts of the Everautumn are to be preserved and protected. Should illness take to that holy place, then that should be thy focus. Similarly, should darkness enshroud the land, you must lift thy torch to it.
  >
  > Understand that these two are not disparate causes, and that they are simply the inner and outer curve of this Ring. There exists forces that twist and bend this loop, which must be dealt with.
  >
  > The Grimm should be studied and understood, but caution should be held in one’s heart that that which has beyond the mycelial blooms of that dark place was never made for mortal eyes. Our texts speak of something dark and sinister there, and we must be vigilant against it.

  > ~Lorna La’vec, Ring Witch of the Lost Woods.

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * Life is a cycle that must be maintained. That which must die should die with respect and dignity. That which should live should be given care and nurturing.  Care must be taken not to unbalance the scales.
  * In all places where the sick and ailing are, be a calm voice of direction and salvation.
  * Continue your good works, until your time is done. Do not reach for eternity. All loops must close.
  * The Grimm is a danger with likely no equal- but fear of it also brings ruin. You must devote yourself to looking into the darkest places, seeking the words of the Ancient Thrylos, who have left cryptic clues and portent warnings of something that resides within it.
  * Study the words of the Death Gods and those of the Everautumn. Know both sides of the Copper coin of death, and know the wisdom of the Lifestream’s waters. Know that there is merit to both, but tie your faith to neither in preference.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  * Ring Witches are born primarily of those individuals who live within The Grimm seeking knowledge beyond what may be found on the Eyes, particularly, Ancient Thrylos texts that speak of great evils.
  * Ring Witches often selectively practice various aspects of both the Worldsoul religious Tenants and The Pharaoh’s Chosen religious tenets.
  * Ring Witches proselytize their faith primarily to those who already believe in at least a portion of what they do, primarily inviting Pharaoh’s Chosen and Children of the Worldsoul to their Coven to exchange philosophy.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of the Pharaoh and Qualifier: Follower of the Worldsoul. This means that the character will become targets of effects with either qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, a Ring Witch, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of the Pharaoh by Radiance.” Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of the Worldsoul By Malice.” As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
