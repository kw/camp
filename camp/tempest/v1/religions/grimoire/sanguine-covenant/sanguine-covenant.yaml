  _Accent: Agony_

  _Primary Eye: Grimoire_

  _Qualifier: “Follower of  Diavalla”_

  _“Come, Children. Drink of the wine of Diavalla’s vein, brought to our court by The Red Mother. Here, your spirit will be tempered to endure things unimaginable. But such is the suffering of the mortal races; Bound and confined within small cages of bone and a weakly beating heart._

  _Lo, heed the words of the Blood Mother, you are destined for more, and with her boon, you shall become more. Drink, my friend, and become an Heir to her majesty."_

  _- Blood Ritualist Nathadriel, Sycophant of the Red Mother_

  ## Tenets of The Devoted

  * Sacrifice is the most holy act of the Covenant, and to rob somebody of their sacrifice is the weightiest sin.
  * Nothing is free. Every debt requires payment with a pound of flesh or pint of blood.
  * The Mortal Breeds are Diavalla’s blessed children, from Human, to Aelth, to the accursed Geist. All Mortal Breeds are her flock, and civilization, and it’s survival, is her primary concern. Creatures that prey upon her flock are to be dealt with. Swiftly and mercilessly. Destroy the beasts that dwell within the dark- or the Light, should they similarly threaten Her Children.
  * Blood Magic is the truest form of Covenant worship. Protect its secrets from those who would suppress it.
  * Pain is proof of one’s life: Without it, death approaches. You are to never shy away from pain, nor suppress the reminder that you are alive. Never seek to end the pain of another for any reason; for that is their honor to bear. When healing, you must always invoke Agony over Radiance.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Religion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Religion, you will have all powers granted by this religion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption or atonement quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Description

  The Sanguine Covenant hold glory to a being known as Diavalla. She takes many names- Mother of Blood, The Red Mother, Mother of Suffering, the Decapitated Goddess to name a few.

  The teachings of Diavalla praise martyrdom, sacrifice, and suffering, and believe that a mortal’s suffering serves as a reminder that they earned the right to continue living. Those who choose to ignore the agonies of adversity are undeserving of the life that the Crimson Mother has provided for them. Intense and overbearing, the Crimson Mother shepherds all mortal breeds.

  In the Past, the Sanguine Covenant was led by a Blood Council of Vampires who had taken root within the heart of the organization, but have since been cleansed of their treachery by the Sisters of Suffering, Blackguard of the Diavallan faith who have devoted their life to the destruction of any and all creatures that would subjugate the Mortal Breeds.

  The Sanguine Covenant’s blade at the throats of Leovitrian Angels has earned them a point of contention with other organized faiths. To the Sisters of Suffering, any who closes a yoke, be it physical or otherwise upon the throats of her Children are undeserving of her mercy- be they skulking Vampire, scheming Demon... Or a vainglorious angel.

  Since the destruction of the Blood Council, the Sisters of Suffering have taken hold of the Temple of Diavalla in Valgast. War-torn and riddled with strife, the battered temple of Diavalla stands as a testament to the Sanguine Covenant’s tenacity, to see themselves through the long struggle of war, strife, and misery.

  During the winter, the covenant holds a rite of passage for any who wish to join the ranks of the Sanguine Covenenant’s Bloodguard, those trained by the Sisters of Suffering for the theater of war in the name of the Covenant’s Faith. This rite usually involves the consumption of demonic or angelic blood, harvested from a fresh sacrifice to the Red Mother.

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this religion gain the Qualifier: Follower of The Sanguine Covenant. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion to this religion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, devoted to The Sanguine Covenant, is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of his order, Killian. Killian prays to their shared god and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Follower of The Sanguine Covenant by Radiance”. Toric heard this call, and is devoted to the religion, and so is healed. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is not a member of the church, but heard the call. They, however, not being a devotee, are not affected by the call._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Follower of The Sanguine Covenant By Malice”. As before, Toric, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Juris is not._
