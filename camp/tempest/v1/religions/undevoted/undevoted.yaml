  _Accent: None_

  _Primary Eye: Any_

  _Qualifier: “The Undevoted”_

  **Note**: Being a denier of the gods in an indisputably divine world comes with many challenges both obvious and otherwise. Be aware that the path of the Undevoted comes with disadvantages in both roleplay and mechanical, and that these may not be apparent at the outset.

  ## Description

  Being without faith in a world dominated by living deities is no mean feat, however, there are those that deny the god’s their supposed right to be worshiped, venerated, and kowtowed to. Collectively, these few are called the “Undevoted”, but there is often little else that connects them to each other. Some Undevoted are simply unwilling to dedicate their lives in service to a divine being, while others harbor great resentment against the divine for causes great and small.

  That said, with the divine sources of power no longer accessible, many devoted seek out other means to accomplish their goals, and a few well trodden paths emerge: Those who forsake magical power entirely, whom rely on skill, reason, and their fellow man exclusively, and then there are those who seek out the arcane exclusively, seeking magical power outside the divine realms.

  ## Tenets of The Undevoted

  * The “Gods” of this world are merely creatures - perhaps of exceptional power, but not immortal, omniscient, or all powerful.
  * Veneration of the “Gods” is unnecessary, and perhaps even degrading to the supplicant.
  * The “powers” granted by the “Gods” are magical in nature, and those with the will to pursue them need no overseer to access them.
  * Those that do venerate the Gods are welcome to do so, provided they harm no others in their actions by doing so.
  * The “Gods” are real, and their actions affect a great many, and so they must be guarded against when necessary.

  _**Note**: If you purchased one or more abilities in this Devotion, and you knowingly break one of the tenets of the Undevoted, you will have all powers granted by this devotion revoked until the end of the event (or longer), and may be subject to a redemption quest to regain these powers, subject to the discretion of the Plot Team._

  ## Qualifier

  All adherents of this devotion gain the Qualifier: The Undevoted. This means that the character will become targets of effects with that qualifier for as long as they maintain devotion. These effects will be both positive and negative, so be sure to be aware of the Calls being made around you.

  _**For Example**: Toric, being Undevoted is fighting on the line during an incursion of undead. Behind them is a cleric of the Highlord, Killian. Killian prays to the Highlord and receives a boon in the form of “By My Voice, Heal 5 to Followers of The Highlord by Radiance”. Toric hears this call, but is Undevoted, and so takes no effect. Meanwhile, Toric’s line companion, Juris, is a member of the church, and hears the call. They, being a devotee of the Highlord, are affected by the call, and are healed._

  _Elsewhere, the undead invasion is not without its necromancer, Yorric. Yorric likewise calls out to their deity, and casts that maleficent gaze upon his foes: “By My Voice, Wounding 4 to Followers of the Highlord By Malice”. As before, Juris, (and his cleric friend) are affected by this call, but his linemate Toric is not._
