description:
  This minor cantrip takes the power out of a Spell-Ball (or multiple Spell-Balls)
  that has already been charged and returns that power to the caster. The Spell-Ball
  becomes inert, and the caster refreshes the Spell-Slot that was used to charge the
  Spell-Ball. If the Spell charges more than one Spell-Ball, all the Spell-Balls must
  still be charged in order to cancel the Spell.
