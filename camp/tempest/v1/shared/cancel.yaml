description: >
  This minor cantrip takes the power out of a spell-ball (or multiple spell-balls) that
  has already been charged and returns that power to the caster. The spell-ball becomes
  inert, and the caster refreshes the spell-slot that was used to charge the spell-ball.
  If the spell charges more than one spell-ball, all the spell-balls must still be charged
  in order to cancel the spell.
