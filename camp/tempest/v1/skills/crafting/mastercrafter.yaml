  Once per event, the crafter may create an item that they can submit to Staff for an artistic boon. An artistic boon will be a special benefit granted to that item, often at random. Depending on the setting, gaining the artistic boon may have some in-game process, such as being left to absorb power in an Arcane Kiln, or getting the blessing of some powerful being.

  This skill may only be taken once, and is tied to the Master level crafting skill used as its prerequisite. If the Mastercrafted item falls into a category of item for which the character has Profession skill (such as Tinkering a sword and having Profession - Weaponsmith), the chances of good or multiple boons will be increased. Exceptional, immersive items (items submitted for a boon along with a physical prop of high production value) that are submitted have a chance of gaining more powerful boons than others.
