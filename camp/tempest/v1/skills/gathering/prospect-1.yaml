description: |
  The character can prospect for Rare Minerals or metal Ingots from the wilderness. Characters may discover mines that can be used
  to prospect for Ingots, or deposits where Rare Minerals can be collected.

  At either a mine or a deposit, the character should read the information card (and only characters with this skill can read the
  information card) at each location for specific information. Normally, the information card will require the Prospector to draw
  from a “mining deck” which will inform the Prospector of the result of the mining session. By default, the character actively
  roleplays for a Slow 180 in order to gain anything from it. Roleplaying requires the use of a mining hammer, which if broken as
  part of prospecting requires repairs before the Prospector may continue. Multiple characters can use the mine or deposit at the same time.

  After the required duration, the character will follow the instructions on the information card, usually drawing from the mining
  deck and gaining resources or taking an effect or damage that corresponds to the level of Prospecting the character possesses.

  Some of these cards may indicate something bad happening to the character like a rockslide or inhaling poisonous fumes. In these
  cases the effect will also be written on the card. The character may prospect at each mine or deposit once per Long Rest.

  For Example: Roger finds one deposit, and knows the location of two mines. After a Long Rest, he makes a circuit, stopping at
  the deposits and mines, spending three minutes at each, to prospect. At each one he receives a number of metal Ingots (mine) or
  Minerals (deposit), but can’t find any Mithril Ore since he doesn’t have Prospect III. He can’t get anything more from any of
  those three locations until after the next Long Rest. After the Long Rest, he then can prospect again at each location.
