name: Scavenging I
cost: 3
description: |
  The character can scavenge Hide, Harvest, and Raw Scale from all manner of creatures. For animals this may represent skinning them while for humanoids it might represent breaking down their gear for parts.

  A character with this skill can use a knife or other sharp tool (not a sword or any weapon of Hand size or larger) to roleplay skinning, scavenging, and harvesting parts from the target for a Quick 100 and will let the portrayer know they are using Scavenging and what rank. The call for this is “Instruction: Give me your Minion Scavenging Token.” The NPC will turn over their Scavenging Token if they possess one.

  Occasionally, some side effects can occur, happening more often with higher value Scavenging Tokens: the Scavenger may be burned by acidic blood, or catch a disease, or be poisoned by exploding stomach gasses. The portrayer of the creature will Call these negative effects.

  The Scavenger will take the tokens at their convenience to NPC Camp and provide it to draw from a deck that corresponds to the type of token they turn in (Minion, Captain, etc).  Tokens should not be given to other Scavengers to turn in, you must turn in your own tokens.  The card the Scavenger draws from the deck will provide them a yield based on the ranks of Scavenger they possess (I, II, or III).  Once they have determined the total yield of all their tokens they will receive those reps from NPC Camp.
