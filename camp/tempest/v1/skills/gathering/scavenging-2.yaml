name: Scavenging II
cost: 3
requires: scavenging-1
description: |
  The NPC will turn over more valuable types of tokens than Scavenging I if a proper skinning knife is used.
  Additionally, the time it takes to Scavenge them is reduced to a Quick 50 plus the time it takes you to receive
  the token from the portrayer. Yields from the Scavenging decks will also be improved.
