description: >
  The NPC will turn over more valuable types of tokens than Scavenging II if a proper skinning knife is used.
  Additionally, the time it takes to Scavenge them is reduced to a Quick 30 plus the time it takes you to receive
  the token from the portrayer. Yields from the Scavenging decks will also be improved.
