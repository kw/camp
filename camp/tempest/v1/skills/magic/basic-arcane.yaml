description: |
  The character learns how to record Arcane spells into a spellbook and Prepare them. They can add four Novice-tier Arcane spells into their spellbook. If the character has levels in an Arcane spell-casting class, these spells must all be spells from one of those classes. This skill confers no actual spell-slots or preparation slots.
