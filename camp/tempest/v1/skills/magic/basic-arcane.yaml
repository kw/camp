description: |
  The character learns how to record Arcane spells into a spellbook and cast spells. They will know one Spell, or however many are listed in their Arcane spellcasting class, whichever is more. If the character has levels in an Arcane spell-casting class, these spells must all be spells from one of those classes. If the character has no spell-casting class, they may choose from any Base Classâ€™s spell list. This skill confers no actual Spell-Slots.
