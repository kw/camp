  The character learns how to record Divine spells into a spellbook. They will know one Spell, or however many are listed in their Divine spellcasting class, whichever is more. If the character has levels in a Divine spell-casting class, these spells must all be spells from one of those classes. If the character has no spell-casting class, they may choose from any Base Classâ€™s spell list. This skill confers no actual spell-slots or preparation slots.
