description: |
  The character can cast Adept level spells directly from their spellbook. Although the spell will still exhaust an Adept Spell-Slot, it need not be Prepared (although it must be a spell the caster could Prepare). To bookcast a spell, the character must be out of combat, then they must either read the full incant five times from their spell-book, or must study their spellbook for a full minute before reading the incantation directly from the book. All other requirements and components will remain the same.
