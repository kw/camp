description: |
  Upon selecting this ability, the character selects a spell from any spell list they
  have access to through their classes, of a Tier they would normally be able to access.
  The character may cast this spell when they are out of combat by expending a spell slot
  and reading the incantation a full five times or actively studying their spell book for
  a full minute, while satisfying all the normal requirements of the spell.
