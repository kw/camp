  Upon selecting this ability, the character selects a spell from any spell list they have access to through their classes, of a Tier they would normally be able to access.  The character may cast this spell when they are out of combat by expending a spell slot and reading the incantation a full five times or actively studying their spell book for a full minute, while satisfying all the normal requirements of the spell.  Additionally, once per event, a player may deposit one Hide and one Bloom into an ashbin and spend 10 minutes writing in their spell book to exchange one spell from their book for another from a list they have access to.
