  - divine.spell_slots
description: |
  The character has learned how to pair the meditative cycles of arcane re-attunement and the
  prayers of divine refreshment. When the character would use a Long Rest Power that refreshes
  their spell slots (ex: Arcane Study, Refreshing Prayer, etc.) they may refresh both Arcane and
  Divine spell slots with the same Short Rest, allowing the character to expend both refreshing
  Powers at the same time.
