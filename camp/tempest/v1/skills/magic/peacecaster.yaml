  Whenever the caster casts a Spell (not Cantrip) with the Heal, Cure, or Grant Life Effects,
  they add 1 point per tier of the Spell  into their Healing Touch  or Life Tap Pools.  If the
  Spell was a Druid Spell, it adds to Life Tap.  If the Spell was a Cleric Spell, it adds to
  Healing Touch.  If the Spell came from some other source, it can add to either Pool.
