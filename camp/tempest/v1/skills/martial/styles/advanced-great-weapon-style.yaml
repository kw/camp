description: |
  The character has trained significantly with Great Weapons and can perform feats of strength otherwise impossible for others.

  They may hold a second weapon in the same hand as a Great Weapon without impeding the effectiveness of the Great Weapon. Although the effectiveness of the Great Weapon is unaffected, the second weapon cannot be used to do damage or block attacks (it is not wielded) if it is held in the same hand as the great weapon.

  **For Example**: A character could hold a polearm normally with two hand with one of those hands also holding a shortsword, and the polearm would still be usable and would be able to do Spikes, do Shield-Breaking damage, etc. if both hands are on the polearm.
