description: |
  An axe is a special short weapon (22"-36") or great weapon (48"-60’’) that must have an obvious "bladed head." The character has a special skill with an axe to sunder shields. Each time the axe strikes a shield, the character can expend a Spike to do Shield-Breaking.

  If using a great weapon that’s an axe, you may instead refresh one Spike whenever you Destroy or Shatter a Shield.
