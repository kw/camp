description: |
  When the character spends a Quick 10 aiming with a projectile weapon, they may choose to do one of the following:

  * Add one to their Base Damage for that shot.
  * Expend a Spike to deliver a Disable Effect. This is called as “Disable [Limb]” where the limb called must be the one struck by the projectile. In the case of held objects, the limb holding the object must be called. Torso hits will allow the character to call any limb they wish.
