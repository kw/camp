  When only using one or two small bladed weapons (each under 21") you find it easier to deal critical damage. While using daggers only, you have +1 Base Maximum Spikes for attacks with daggers. This bonus to Maximum Spikes is a Base change, and does not interact with the stacking rules for Maximum Spikes.
