  When only using one or two bladed hand weapons (each under 22"), they may spend a Spike to do an attack that does “Piercing 1 by Force.” This attack can’t be modified other than changing its accent. In addition, whenever the character Counters an attack that hits their hand weapons they may regain a Spike.
