description: |
  A mace is a special short weapon (22"-36") or great weapon (48"+) that must have an obvious "head" and must have its center of balance closer to the head than the pommel, or is a flail.  The character is skilled with a mace and can use it to crush through shields to damage their enemies. Each time the mace is blocked by a shield, the character may expend a Spike to add Wounding to that attack with a mace.

  Note: This Power cannot be used with other Powers or be modified in any way.
