description: |
  The character must choose from the following list: Dagger, Sword, Mace, Axe, Projectile Weapons, Thrown Weapons, Staff or Polearm.  Note: Flails are considered Maces, per Macecraft.  After each Short Rest, the character gains one additional Spike that can only be used while the character is wielding a weapon of that type (although the actual attack need not come from that weapon). A character may only have Weapon Specialization with one weapon type.
