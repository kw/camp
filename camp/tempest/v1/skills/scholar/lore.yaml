  The character has learned about a specific area of study, with each area of study considered a separate skill. Lore confers a level of knowledge that is both deep and detailed, although not quite encyclopedic, and represents a long commitment to education on the topic. The more granular the area of knowledge, the more specific the knowledge is likely to be. The following is a list of suggested areas of study. Players should feel free to choose ones not in this list as long as they are appropriate to the setting.
