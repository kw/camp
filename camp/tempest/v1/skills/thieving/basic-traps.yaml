description: |
  This skill allows a character to attempt to disarm traps. See the Traps and Locks chapter for details. Without this skill any attempt to manipulate a trap, including moving it, cutting wires, or anything else (other than simply avoiding it) will set the trap off, even if the trigger is not activated. The character with this skill may use props at hand, tools, or in-game items to stop the trap from going off. If the trap does go off, making its noise or performing whatever action indicates that it has been sprung, then the trap has gone off normally. There is no default prohibition about what can be done to the trap (i.e. wires can be cut, mechanisms jammed, etc.). However, the trap prop itself should not be damaged.

  In addition, this Skill allows the character to read the front of a Trap card, if it is able to be seen without moving it. This will generally reveal the trigger conditions for the trap, and may even automatically disable the trap.
