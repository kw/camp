description: |
  The character has functional knowledge in a profession. The character can perform all normal functions of the chosen profession and they will show solid knowledge related to it. Most tasks associated with that profession can be performed without aid or supervision. The character can choose one Profession-related Discern question and can ask it at-will (such as “Discern: Which civilization built this?” for a mason). This question should be approved by Staff (between games) and at Staff discretion, the question may be allowed to have the Subtle Modifier.

  **Note**: This should be a different profession than the one used for the prerequisite.
