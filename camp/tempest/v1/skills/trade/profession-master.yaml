description: |
  The character has mastered their chosen profession. They can perform the most complicated tasks and have a deep knowledge of lore associated with that mastery. The character’s mastery earns income represented by earning 6 Wealth at the beginning of each game, in addition to what they earn from their Apprentice and Journeyman skills. In addition, the character can choose one additional Profession-related Discern question and can ask it at-will (such as “Discern: Does this stone wall seem to be moveable?” for a mason). This question should be approved by Staff (between games) and at Staff discretion, the question may be allowed to have the Subtle Modifier.
